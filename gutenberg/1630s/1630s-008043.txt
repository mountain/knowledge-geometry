         VING VERTVES OF SYR _PHILLIP_
          _SYDNEY_ KNIGHT; AND TO THE
        RIGHT HONORABLE AND OTHERS WHAT-

  To the Right Honourable Robert
  Deuorax, Earle of Essex and Ewe, Viscount
  Hereford, and Bourghchier, Lorde Ferrers of Chartley,
  Bourghchier and Louaine, Maister of the Queenes Maiesties
  _Horse, and Knight of the most noble order of the Garter:_
  Is wished, the perfection of all happinesse, and tryumphant
  felicitie in this life, and in the worlde
  to come.

When I had determined (Right honorable) to dedicate this Booke, to the
euerlyuing vertues of that matchlesse Knight Syr _Phillip Sydney_; me
thought that I could not finde out a more Noble personage then your
selfe, and more fit, to patronize, shield, and defende my dutie to the
deade, then your Honour, whose greatnes is such, and vertues of that
power, as who so commendeth them, deserueth not to be accounted a
flatterer, but he that doth not the same, may be thought an euill
willer. Hovv your Honor vvill accept hereof, I make no doubt, because
that curtesie attendeth vpon true nobilitie; but my humble request is,
that your Honor may not thinke of me (by the tytle of the Booke, and
some part of the discourse) as if I vvere amorous, and did speake
according to my ovvne passions, for I beeing restrained of my liberty,
and helde in the graue of obliuion, where I still as yet remaine,
oppressed with Melancholie, and wearied vvith deeper studies, I vvas
glad to beguile the time with these conceits, anothomising in them,
the vanitie of this life, and vncertaintie of the delights therof,
in the Dreame of _Poliphilus_; Which if it shall please your Honor at
conuenient leysure to looke ouer, pardoning what you finde amisse,
and weighing my good will, I shall thinke my selfe most happy.

And thus I humbly take my leaue, vntill that I may present your Honour,
with a matter more fitting the same.

    _Your Honors deuoted,_

                     R. D.

                      [Decoration]

               Poliphili hypnerotomachia,
        Wherein he sheweth, that all humaine and
worldlie things are but a dreame, and but as vanitie it
   _selfe. In the setting foorth whereof many things_
          are figured worthie of remembrance.


_The Author beginneth his _Hypnerotomachia_, to set downe the hower
  and time when in his sleepe it seemed to him that hee was in a quiet
  solitarie desart, and vninhabited plaine, and from thence afterward
  how he entered vnaduisedly before he was aware, with great feare,
  into a darke obscure and vnfrequented wood._


The discription of the morning.

What houre as _Phœbus_[a] issuing foorth, did bewtifie with brightnesse
the forhead of _Leucothea_[b], and appearing out of the Occean waues,
not fully shewing his turning wheeles, that had beene hung vp, but
speedily with his swift horses _Pyrous_ & _Eous_[c], hastning his
course, and giuing a tincture to the Spiders webbes, among the greene
leaues and tender prickles of the Vermilion Roses, in the pursuite
whereof he shewed himselfe most swift & glistering, now vpon the neuer
resting and still moouing waues, he crysped vp his irradient heyres.

    [Sidenote a: Phæbus the Sunne.]

    [Sidenote b: Leucothea the morning.]

    [Sidenote c: Pyr & Eo, the horses of the Sunne.]

Vppon whose vprising, euen at that instant, the vnhorned Moone
dismounted hir selfe, losing from hir Chariot hir two horses, the one
white and the other browne, and drewe to the Horrison[d] different from
the Hemisphere[e] from whence she came.

    [Sidenote d: Horison a circle deuiding the halfe speare of the
    firmament from the other halfe which we doe not see.]

    [Sidenote e: Hemispere is halfe the compasse of the visible heauen.]

And when as the mountaines and hilles were beautifull, and the northeast
winds had left of to make barraine with the sharpnesse of their blasts,
the tender sprigs to disquiet the moouing reedes, the fenny Bulrush, and
weake Cyprus, to torment the foulding Vines, to trouble the bending
Willowe, and to breake downe the brittle Firre bowghes, vnder the hornes
of the lasciuious Bull, as they do in winter.

At that very houre, as the diuers coulered flowers and greene meades, at
the comming of the sunne of _Hypperion_[f] feare not his burning heate,
being bedued and sprinkled with the Christalline teares of the sweete
morning, when as the _Halcyons_[g] vpon the leuell waues of the stil,
calme, and quiet flowing seas, do build their nests in sight of the
sandie shore, whereas the sorrowfull _Ero_, with scalding sighes did
behold the dolorous and vngrate departure of hir swimming _Leander_[h].

    [Sidenote f: Hyperion the Sunne.]

    [Sidenote g: Halcyons are certaine byrds which building near the
    shore vpon the waues there will be no storme vntill the young be
    hatched.]

    [Sidenote h: Leander a young man of Abydos, who in swimming ouer
    Hellespont (a narow sea) by Byzantium, which parteth Europ from
    Asia) to Sestus, was in the sight of his louer Ero of Sestus
    drowned, which she seeing, threw hir self down into the sea, and
    died with him.]

I lying vpon my bed, an oportune and meet freend to a wearie body, no
creature accompaning me in my chamber, besides the attender vppon my
body, and vsuall night lights, who after that she had vsed diuers
speeches, to the end shee might comfort me, hauing vnderstood before of
me, the originall cause of my hollow and deepe sighes, she indeuored hir
best to moderate, if at least she might, that, my perturbed and
pittifull estate. But when she sawe that I was desirous of sleepe, she
tooke leaue to depart.

Then I being left alone to the high cogitations of loue, hauing passed
ouer a long and tedious night without sleepe, through my barren fortune,
and aduerse constellation, altogether vncomforted and sorrowfull, by
means of my vntimely and not prosperous loue, weeping, I recounted from
point to point, what a thing vnequall loue is: and how fitly one may
loue that dooth not loue: and what defence there may bee made against
the vnaccustomed, yet dayly assaults of loue: for a naked soule
altogether vnarmed, the seditious strife, especially being intestine:
a fresh still setting vpon with vnstable and new thoughts.

In this sort brought to so miserable an estate, and for a long while
plunged in a deepe poole of bitter sorrowes, at length my wandring
sences being wearie to feede still vpon vnsauorie and fayned pleasure,
but directly and without deceit, vppon the rare diuine obiect: whose
reuerende _Idea_ is deeply imprinted within me, and liueth ingrauen in
the secret of my heart, from which proceedeth this so great and
vncessant a strife, continually renuing my cruell torments without
intermission. I began the conditions of those miserable louers, who for
their mistresses pleasures desire their owne deaths, and in their best
delights do think themselues most vnhappie, feeding their framed
passions not otherwise then with fithfull imaginations. And then as a
weary bodye after a sore labour, so I, somewhat in outward shew
qualified, in the payne of my sorrowfull thoughts, and hauing
incloystered and shut vp the course of my distilling teares: whose drops
had watered my pale cheekes, thorow amorous griefe, desired some
needfull rest.

At length my moyst eyes being closed within their bloudshotten and
reddish liddes, presently betwixt a bitter life and a sweet death, I was
in them inuaded and ouercome, with a heauie sleepe, who with my minde
and watchfull spirits, were no pertakers of so high an operation.

Me thought that I was in a large, plaine, and champion place, all greene
and diuersly spotted with many sorted flowerrs, wherby it seemed
passingly adorned. In which by reason of the milde and gentle ayre,
there was a still quyet whisht: Inso much that my attentiue eares did
heare no noyse, neither did any framed speech peirce into them, but with
the gratious beames of the sunne, the sliding time passed.

In which place with a fearefull admiration, looking about me, I sayd
thus to my selfe. Heere appeareth no humaine creature to my sight, nor
syluã beast, flying bird, coũtrey house, field tent, or shepheards cote:
neyther vpon the gras could I perceiue feeding eyther flock of sheep,
or heard of cattell, or rustike herdman with Oten pipe making pastorall
melodie, but onely taking the benefit of the place, and quietnesse of
the plaine, which assured mee to be without feare, I directed my course
still forward, regarding on eyther side the tender leaues and thick
grasse, which rested vnstirred, without the beholding of any motion.

At length my ignorant sleepes, brought me into a thick wood, whereinto
being a pritty way entred, I could not tell how to get out of it.
Wherevpon, a soddaine feare inuaded my hart, and diffused it selfe into
euery ioynt, so that my couler began to waxe pale, and the rather by
reason that I was alone, and vnarmed, and could not finde any track or
path, eyther to direct me forward, or lead me back againe. But a darke
wood of thicke bushes, sharpe thornes, tall ashes haled of the Viper,
towgh Elmes beloued of the fruitfull vines, harde Ebony, strong Okes,
soft Beeche, and browne Hasils, who intertaining one anothers branches,
with a naturall goodwill opposed themselues, to resist the entrance of
the gratious sunne shine, with the greene couerture of their innumerable
leaues. And in this sort I found my selfe in a fresh shadowe, a coole
ayre, and a solytarie thicket.

VVherevpon my reason perswaded me to beleeue, that this vast wood, was
onely a receptacle for sauage and hurtfull beasts, as the tusked
Bore, the furious and bloudthirstie Beare, the hissing serpent, and
inuading VVoolfe, against which I was vnprouided to make resistance, but
rayther as a praye sent amongst them, miserablie to haue my flesh and
bones rent and gnawne in peeces.

And thus forecasting the woorst that might follow, I was resolued not to
abide there, but to seeke to get out, that I might the better eschew
such suspected occurrents, and taking my selfe to my feete, I wandred
now this way, now that way, sometime to the right hand, sometime to the
left: nowe forwarde, then backe againe, not knowing how to goe among the
thicke bowghes and tearing thornes, bearing vpon my face: rending my
clothes, and houlding me sometimes hanging in them, whereby my hast in
getting foorth was much hyndered. In this vnaccustomed labour: and
without any helpe but onely the keeping of the sunne still vpon one
side, to direct mee streight forwarde: I grewe extreamely hoate and
faynte, not knowing what to doe, but onely in a wearye body, to conteine
a minde distraught through troublesome thoughts, breathing out hollow
and deepe sighes, desiring helpe of the pittifull _Cretensian Ariadne_,
who for the destroying of hir monstrous brother the _Mynotaur_[A] gaue
vnto the deceitfull _Theseus_ a clew of thred, to conduct him foorth of
the intricate laborinth, that I also by some such meanes might be
deliuered out of this obscure wood.

    [Sidenote A: Minotaurus a monster in Creete, born of Pasiphae which
    being inclosed in the laborinth fed on mans flesh, whome Theseus
    slew and got out of the laborinth by a clew of thred giuen by
    Ariadne king Minoes daughter, after wife to Theseus, who did forsake
    hir, and left hir in a disinhabited Ile, notwithstanding that she
    had saued his life.]

_Poliphilus being thus distempered in this daungerous and obscure wood,
  at length getteth foorth, and being come to a faire Riuer, indeuoring
  to rest himselfe and coole his heate, he heard a most delightful
  harmonie, which made him forget to drinke, and followe after the
  voice, which brought him to a woorse perplexitie._


Feare and desire of freedome thus occupying my sences, my vnderstanding
was blinded, neyther did I knowe whether it were better for mee eyther
to wishe for hated death, or in so dreadfull a place to hope for desired
life. Thus euery way discontent, I did indeuour, with all force and
diligence to get foorth, wherin the more I did striue the more I found
my selfe intangled, and so infeebled with wearinesse, that on euery side
I feared, when some cruell beast should come and deuoure me, or els
vnawares to tumble downe into some deepe pit or hollow place.

Wherefore more trembling then in mustulent _Autume_ be the yealow
coulored leaue, hauing left their moisture, being thorowlye searched
with the furious north winde, I lifted vp my hart to God, desiring as
_Achemenides_ being afraide of the horrible _Cyclops_ rather to be
slaine by the hands of _Aeneas_ his enemie, rather then to suffer so
odious a death.

And my deuoute prayer, sincerely vnited to a contrite heart, powring out
a fountaine of teares with a stedfast beliefe to be deliuered. I found
my selfe in a short space gotten at libertie, like a new day crept out
of a darke and tempestuous night. My eyes before vsed to such obumbrated
darkenes, could scarse abide to behould the light, thorow watery sadnes.
Neuerthelesse glad I was to see the light: as one set at libertie, that
had beene chayned vp in a deepe dungeon and obscure darkenesse. Verye
thirstie I was, my clothes torne, my face and hands scratched and
netteled, and withall so extreamely set on heate, as the fresh ayre
seemed to doe me more hurt then good, neither did it any waye ease my
body, desirous to keepe his new recouered scope and libertie.

And after that I had a little rowsed vp my mynde, and sommoned together
my sences in some better sort: I sought a meanes to quench my inordinate
thyrst, procured and increased through innumerable sighes, and extreame
labour of body. Thus casting my eyes with a diligent regarde about the
plaine, to finde some Fountaine whereat I might refresh my selfe: a
pleasant spring or head of water, did offer it selfe vnto me, with a
great vayne boyling vp, about the which did growe diuers sweet hearbes
and water flowers, and from the same did flowe a cleare and chrystalline
current streame, which deuided into diuers branches, ran thorow the
desart wood, with a turning and winding body, receyuing into it other
little channels, vnlading themselues.

In whose courses the stones lift vp by nature, and trunkes of trees
denyed any longer by their roots to be vpholden, did cause a stopping
hinderance to their current and whuzing fall, which still augmented by
other vndissonant torrents, from high and fertlesse mountaines in the
plaine, shewed a beautifull brightnes and soft passing course, to the
which short windedly comming, by meanes of my fearefull flight. I did
see a little obscure light, thorow the tops of the high trees, somewhat
deuiding themselues ouer the water, and with the rest of their bodyes
and branches, as it were seperating the heauens from my lifted vp eyes.
A horrible place to be in, vnaccompanyed of any creature.

And suddainly hearing the fall of trees, through the force of a
whyrlewinde, & noise of the broken bowghes, with a redoubled and hoarse
sound a farre of, and yet brought to the eccho of the water thorow the
thick wood, I grew into a new astonishment.

And at this instant thus terrified and afflycted, and yet without any
receiued hurt, being vpon my knees bowed downe, and inclosing the
hollownesse of my hand, therewith determined to make me a necessary
drinking vessel: I had no sooner put the same into the water, offring to
my mouth the long desired moysture, thereby to refrygerate and coole the
extreame heate of my burning heart, which at that time would haue beene
more acceptable vnto me, then eyther _Hypanis_ and _Ganges_ be to the
_Indians_, _Tigris_ or _Euphrates_ to the _Armenians_, or _Xeylus_ to
the _Aethiopian_ nation, or to the _Egyptians_ his innundation, inbybing
theyr burnt and rosted mould, or yet the riuer _Po_ to the _Ligurians_.

Euen then also it fell so out, that I had no sooner taken water into the
palme of my hand, offering the same to my open mouth, ready to receiue
it: I heard a doricall songe, wherewith I was as greatly delighted,
as if I had heard the Thracian _Thamiras_, which thorough my eares
presented it selfe to my vnquiet heart, with so sweete and delectable a
deliuerie, with a voyce not terrestriall, with so great a harmonie and
incredible a fayning shrilnesse, and vnusuall proportion, as is possible
to bee imagined by no tounge sufficiently to be commended. The sweetnes
whereof so greatly delighted me, as thereby I was rauished of my
remembrance, and my vnderstanding so taken from me, as I let fall my
desired water thorough the loosned ioynts of my feeble hands.

And then euen as a birde, which through the sweetnes of the call
forgetteth to remember the Fowlers deceit, so I letting slip that which
nature stood in need of, hastened my selfe back with all speed, towarde
that attractiue melodie, which the more I coasted, the further it seemed
still from me, sometime heere, sometimes there, and still as I shifted
places, so the same also chaunged with a delectable voyce and heauenly
consent. Thus vainly running vp and downe, I knew not after what, I grew
more wearie, faint, and drye, and so feeble, that my legges could but
with great paine, vphould my distempered body. And my grieued spirits
vnabled long to support the same, what with the feare that I had bin in,
what with extreame thirst, what with long and wilesome trauell, and what
with doubting the worst that might insue. Thus hote, faint, and drye:
I knew not what to do but euen to procure rest for my weary members.
I marueled first at this straunge accedent, and was amazed at this
inhumane harmonye, but most of all in that I was in a straunge contry,
and vninhabited, being onelye fertill and beawtyfull to behould, besydes
that I greatly sorrowed for the losse of the fayer ryuer which I had so
greatly labored to finde out, and now so lightly and carelesly to haue
lost the benefit thereof. In this sort I was houlden in an intrycate
minde of doubts, at length ouercome withall kinde of greefes, my whole
bodye trembling and languishinge vnder a broade and mightye Oke full of
Acornes, standing in the middest of a spatious and large green meade,
extending forth his thicke and leauie armes to make a coole shadowe,
vnder whose bodye breathing I rested my selfe vppon the deawye hearbes,
and lying vppon my left syde I drewe my breath in the freshe ayre more
shortly betwixt my drye and wrinckled lips, then the weary running
heart, pinched in the haunche and struck in the brest, not able any
longer to beare vp his weighty head, or sustaine his body vpon his
bowing knees, but dying prostrates himselfe. And lying thus in such an
agonie, I thought vpon the strifes of weake fortune, and the
inchauntments of the malicious _Cyrces_, as if I had by hir charmes and
quadranguled plaints, been bereaued of my sences. In these such so great
& exceeding doubts: O _hi me_ where might I there among so many dyuerse
and sundry sorts of hearbes, finde the _Mercurial Moli_[A] with his
blacke roote, for my helpe and remedie. Againe me thought that it was
not so with me. What then? euen a hard appoyntment to delay my desired
death. And thus remayning in these pernitious thoughts, my strength
debylitated: I looked for no other helpe, but to drawe and receiue fresh
ayre into that brest, which panted with a small remainder of vytall
warmnesse, taking into my hands halfe aliue, as my last refuge, the
moyst and bedewed leaues, preserued in the coole shadow of the greene
Oke: putting the same to my pale and drye lippes, with a greedy desire
in licking of them to satisfie my distempred mouth with theyr moisture,
wishing for such a wel as _Hypsipyle_[a] shewed the Grecians: Fearing
least that vnawares as I had russled in the wood I were bitten with the
serpent _Dipsa_[b] my thirst was so vnsupportable. Then renuing my oulde
cogitations: as _I_ lay vnder this mightie Oke: I was oppressed with
emynent sleepe ouer all my members: where againe I dreamed in this
sorte.

    [Sidenote A: Moly an herb greatly commended of Homer, and thought to
    be souereigne against inchauntments of moderne authors altogether
    vnknowne.]

    [Sidenote a: Hypsipile was daughter to Thaos king of Lemnos, who
    alone when all women of that Iland had slaine their husbands &
    kinsmen, saued hir father: she also shewed the Grecians the
    fountaine Langia in the wood of Nemea in Achaia where Hercules slue
    a lion.]

    [Sidenote b: Dipsa a kind of snakes that Lucan mentioneth, whose
    byting procureth extreame drynes or thirste.]




_Poliphilus sheweth, that he thought he did sleep againe, and in his
  dreame thas he was in a Vallie, inuironed with mountaines and hilles,
  the end whereof was shut vp in a maruellous sort, with a mightie
  pyramides worthie of admiration: vpon the top whereof was a high
  obeliske, which with great pleasure hee beheld, and diligently
  discribeth_.


Gotten foorth of this fearefull and thick wood, and forgetting the
forementioned places by this sweete sleepe, occasioned by my wearie
members nowe layde along: mee thought that I was in a new more
delectable place, far excelling the former, which consisted not of
fertles mountaines and craggie winding rockes, contayning wide caues,
but being a delicate valley, in the which did rise a small mounting of
no great height, sprinkled heare and there with young Okes, Ashes, Palme
trees broadleaued, _Aesculies_,[a] Holme, Chestnut, Sugerchist, Poplars,
wilde Oliue, and Oppies disposed some hyer then other, according to the
mounting or fall of the place, in the plaine whereof was an other kinde
of thicket of medicinable simples like little young trees, as the
flowering _Genista_[b] enuironed with diuers green hearbs, Tetrifolie,
Sheere grasse, hunnisuckle, the musked Angelica, Crowfoot Elapium and
Rugwoort, with other profitable and vnknowne hearbes and flowers heare
and there diuerslie disposed. A little beyond in the same valley, I
founde a sandie or grauelly plaine, yet bespotted with greene tuffes, in
which place grew a faire Palme tree with his leaues like the Culter of a
plowe, and abounding with sweet and pleasant fruite, some set high, some
lowe, some in a meane, some in the very top, an elect and chosen signe
of victorie. Neither in this place was there any habitation or creature
whatsoeuer. Thus walking solitarily betwixt the trees, growing distantly
one from another, I perswaded my selfe, that to this no earthly
situation was comparable: in which thought I soddainely espied vpon my
left hand, an hungrie and carniuorous Woolfe, gaping vpon me with open
mouthe.

    [Sidenote a: Aesculus is a tree bearing both greater fruite and
    broder leaues then the Oke.]

    [Sidenote b: Gemista beareth a cod and yellowe flower, vines are
    bound therewith. Elaphium is like to Angelica, but not in smell, the
    hart thereon rubbeth his head when it is veluet.]

At the sight whereof immediatly, my hayre stood right vp, and I would
haue cryed out, but could not: and presently the Woolfe ranne away:
wherevpon returning to my selfe, and casting my eyes towards the wooddie
mountaines, which seemed to ioyne themselues together, beeing looked
vnto a farre off, I sawe the forme of a tower of an incredible heygth,
with a spyre vnperfectlie appearing, all being of very auncient forme
and workemanship.

And drawing neare vnto this building, I beheld the gratious mountaines
before a farre of seeming small, by comming neerer and neerer, by little
and little, to lift vp themselues more and more, at the first seeming to
mee that they had ioyned together with the building which was an
inclosure or end of the valley betwixt mountaine and mountaine: which
thing I thought worthy the noting, and without further delay I addressed
my selfe more neerer therevnto. And by how much the more I approximated
the same, by so much the more the excellencie of the woorke shewed it
selfe, increasing my desire to behould the same. For there appeared no
longer a substance of vnknowne forme, but a rare Obelisk vpon a vast
frame and stonie foundation, the heigth whereof without comparison did
exceed the toppes of the sidelying mountaynes, although I thought that
they had beene the renowmed _Olympus_[a], the famous _Caucasus_[b], and
not inferior to _Cyllenus_[c].

    [Sidenote a: Olimpus a hil in Greece between Macedonie and Thesalie,
    so high, that of the Poets it is sometime taken for heauen.]

    [Sidenote b: Caucasus a mightie hill in Asia which parteth India
    from Scythia.]

    [Sidenote c: Cillenus a hill of Arcadia, where Iupiter begat
    Mercurie vpon Maia.]

To this sollitarie place thus desiredlye comming, with vnspeakeable
delight, at pleasure I behelde the straunge manner of the arte, the
hugenesse of the frame, and the woonderfull excellencie of the
woorkmanship. Maruelling and considering the compasse and largenesse of
this broken and decayed obiect, made of the pure glistering marble of
_Paros_[d]. The squared stones ioyned togither without anye cement, and
the pointed quadrangulate corner stones streightlye fitted and smoothlye
pullished, the edges whereof were of an exquisite vermellion coulour, as
is possible to bee deuised: and so iust set, as betwixt the ioynts, euen
the enemie to the woorke (if euer there were anye) could not deuise to
hide the point of the smallest spanish needle vsed of the best
workewomen. And there in this so noble a piece of worke, I found a
proportioned substance to euery shape and likenesse that can be thought
vpon and called to remembrance, partly decayed, and some still whole
remaining, with pillers small vpon great, with their excellent heads of
an exact and most perfect closing, crowned battelments, embost caruings,
bearing forth like embroderie, arched beames, mightie mettaline images,
ouerthrowne and broken in sunder, the trunke of their exact and perfect
members, appearing hollow of brasse. Skyffes, small boates and vessels
of _Numidian_ stone and _Porphyr_, and diuers couloured marble. Great
lauers condites, and other infinite fragments of notable woorkmanship,
far different and inferiour from that they were, in their perfection,
but now brought back as it were to their first vnshapelines, being
fallen and cast downe, some heere, some there, vpon the earth from the
which they were taken. Among the broken and decayed places, wherof great
sundrie wall weeds and hearbes, especially the vnshaking Anagyre, the
Lentise of both kindes, beares foote, dogges head, Gladen greene,
spotted Iuie, Centarie, and diuers suchlike. And in the myldered places
of broken walles grew Howslike, and the hanging Cymbalaria bryers, and
pricking brambles, among the which crept Swifts and Lyzarts which I sawe
crawling among the ouergrowne stones, which at the first sight in this
silent and solitarie place, made me to be warily afraid of them. On
euery side there lay fallen downe smoothe round pieces of serpent
spotted Marble, purple and red diuerse couloured. Fragments of strange
histories, _Panglyphic_ and _Hemygliphic_[E] compendiously caracterized,
shewing the excellencie thereof, vndoubtedly accusing our age, that the
perfection of such an art is forgotten.

    [Sidenote d: Paros is one of the 35. Isles called Cyclades and
    Sporades, in the sea Aegeum which deuideth Europ from Asia.]

    [Sidenote E: Panglyphic be wholy carued from the head to the foote
    in all members. Hemigliphic apeare but halfe.]

Then comming to the myddle fronture of the great and excellent woorke,
I sawe one sole large and marueylous porche worthy of great estimation,
proportioned according to the huge quantitie of the rest of the whole
work, which was placed betwixt and continued in building from the one
and the other of the mountaines hare lipped, and aboue arched, whose
space betwixt as I doe coniecture was in measure sixe furlongs, and
twelue paces. The top of which mountaines were perpendicularly equall
eyther of them touching the azur’d skey. At the sight whereof I imagined
with my selfe and deuised to thinke with what yron instruments, with
what labour of mens hands, and number of workmen, such a piece of woorke
could bee by great strength framed, with much paine layde together, and
a long time in finishing. There then this woonderfull frame willingly as
it were ioyned hands and vnited it selfe with the one and the other
mightie mountaines, by meanes whereof, the foresaid valley there had an
end, that no man could go further forward or backe againe, but to enter
in by this broade, large, and wide open porche.

Vpon this massie frame and mightie woorkmanship, which I take to be in
heigth from the roofe or top to the foote, fiue parts of a furlong, was
placed a high and woonderfull Pyramides, after the fashion of a square
poynted Diamond, and such incredible workemanship that could neuer be
deuised and erected, without inestimable charge, great helpe, and long
time. So that I thought the excellencie thereof vnthought vpon, to bee a
myrrour, the sight whereof was able to dasell any humaine eyes, and
quaile the rest of the spirituall sences. VVhat shall I say more? for so
far as the reache of my capacitie will afoorde me leaue, in this sort I
briefely describe the same.

Euery side or quarter of this foure squared frame, wherevpon the foote
of the Pyramides did stand, did extend themselues in length six
furlongs[A], which in compasse about euery side æquilatered of like
bredth, dooth multiplie to 24 furlongs. Then lifting vp the lynes on
high from the foure corners, so much as euerye corner is distant in
length from another, meeting in the top, so as the Perpendicular line
may fall iust vpon the center of the Dyagon, stretching from both
corners of the plynts or square foote, iust and conueniently ioyned
together doe make a perfect pyramidall figure. VVhich immence and
woonderfull forme, with a maruelous and exquise Symmetrie and due
proportion mounting vp laboursomly foote by foote, conteyned 1410.
degrees or steppes, taking away 10. degrees to make vp the head and
gracilament of the Pyramides in whose place was set a huge Cube or foure
square stone of forme like a dye, sound and firme of a monstrous
thicknesse and incredible weight to bee carryed so high. And of the same
stone of _Paros_ as were the steps: which cube and square stone was the
Basis and foote set vnder the Obilisk, which I haue in hand to describe.

    [Sidenote A: A furlong is 16. pole euery pole being 16 foote.]

This mightie big stone sharpe topt, sliding downe the extream part from
corner to corner, flat sided by the Diameter, was fower paces, at euery
equall distant corner, whereof was the foote of a harpie of moulten
mettall, their steales and clawes armed. Firmlye and stronglie set in
with led, in euery corner of the Cube, or foure square head of the
Pyramides, meeting together ouer the Diagonike line. Of proportioned
thicknesse in heigth two paces. Which thus closing and mette together,
made the socket of the great Obelisk: which Socket was beautified with
leaues, fruites and flowers, of shining cast mettall, and of conuenient
bignesse. VVherevpon the weight of the Obelisk was borne. The breadth
whereof was two paces, and seauen in heigth, artificiously sharping of
the stone of _Thebais_ called _Pyrus_. Vpon the smooth plains whereof,
pure and bright shining as a looking glasse, were moste excellently cut
_Aegiptian Hyerogliphs_.

Vpon the pointe of which Obelisk, with great arte and diligence, was
fastned a copper base, in the which also there was a turning deuise
infixed: whervpon did stand the shape of a beautifull nimph framed of
the aforesayd matter, able to amaze the continuall diligent behoulder.
Of such a proportion as the common stature might be considered and
perfectly seene, notwithstanding the exceeding heigth thereof in the
ayre. Besides the greatnesse of the figure or image: it was a woonder to
thinke how such a weight should bee carryed and set in such a place and
so high. Couered with a habite blowne abroad with the winde, and shewing
parte of the naked substance of the legges and thighes: with two wings
growing out from the shoulder blades, and spred abroad as if shee were
readye to flye, turning hir fayre face and sweete regarding countenance
towardes hir wings. The tresses of hir haire flying abroade the vpper
part or crowne naked and bare. In hir right hand she held from hir sight
a copie or horne stuft full of many good things, stopped vp, and the
mouth downewarde, hir left hand fastned and harde holden to hir naked
brest. This Image and stature was with euery blast of wind turned, and
mooued about with such a noyse and tinkling in the hollownes of the
metaline deuise: as if the mynte of the Queene of England had being
going there. And when the foote of the phane or Image in turning about,
did rub and grinde vpon the copper base, fixed vpon the pointe of the
Obeliske, it gaue such a sound, as if the tower bell of Saint Iohns
Colledge in the famous Vniuersitie of Cambridge had beene rung: or that
in the pompeous Batches of the mightie _Hadrian_: or that in the fift
Pyramides standing vpon foure. This Obeliske in my iudgement was such,
as neyther that in the _Vaticane_ in _Alexandria_ or Babilon, may bee
equally compared vnto it, but rather esteemed far inferiour. It
conteined in it such a heape of woonders, as I could not without great
astonishment looke vpon it. As also consider the hugenesse of the worke,
the excessiue sumptuousnesse, the straunge inuention, the rare
performance, and exquisite diligence of the woorkeman. With what art
inuented? with what power, humaine force, and incredible meanes, enuying
(if I may speake it) the workmanship of the heauens, such and so mightie
weights should be transported and carryed into the skyes? with what
Cranes, winding beames, Trocles, round pullies, Capres bearing out
deuices, and Poliplasies, and drawing frames, and roped tryces, therein
being vnskilfull, I slip it ouer with silence.

_And heere on the other side followeth the figure._

  [Illustration]

Let vs returne then to the huge Pyramides, standing vpon a strong and
sound plynth or foure square foote, fourteene paces in heigth, and in
length sixe furlongs, which was the foundation and bottom of the
weightie pyramides, which I perswaded my selfe was not brought from any
other place, but euen with plaine labour and workemanship hewen out of
the selfe same mountaines, and reduced to this figure and proportion in
his owne proper place.

Which great quadrant and square woorke, ioyned not fast to the
collaterate and sidelying rockes, but was betwixt spaced and seperated
on eyther sides tenne paces. Vpon the right hand as I went of the
aforesaid plynth or square sheame, there was most perfectly carued the
vyperous head of the fearefull _Medusa_, in a most furious and rigorous
forme to looke vpon, and as it were yelling out: with terrible eyes
cauernate, and hollow skowling vnder ther ouerhanging browes with a
wrympled and forrowed forehead and gaping wide open mouth, which being
hollowed with a dyrect waye from the Catill, and vppon stone by a
mediane lyne perpendicular to the center of the far shewing Pyramides,
made a large enterance and cõming vnto it, at which opening mouth,
compassed with fowlded haires of vnrepartable curiousnes artificiall
cunning and costly woorkmanshyppe the assending the turning stayers
shewed them selues, and instead of tresses of haire platted with laces,
I saw fearefull vypers and winding serpents growing out from the scalpe
of the monstrous head confusedly twysting together and hissing, so
liuely portrayed and set foorth, that they made me afrayde to behould
them. In their eyes were placed most shining stones, in such sort, as if
I had not beene perswaded and knowne that they were stones indeed,
I durst not haue drawne neere them.

And the aforesayde entrie cut out of the firme stone, led to the scale
and compassing passage in the center, with winding steps tending to the
highest parte of the stately Pyramides, and opening vpon the outside of
the catill or cube: vpon the which the shining obeliske was founded. And
among the rest of such notable partes that I beheld, me thought that
this deuise was woorth the noting, because the artifitious and most
cunning architect with an exquisite and perspicuous inuention, had made
to the stayres certaine loopes or small windowes, imbracing the
bountifull beames of the sunne correspondently on three parts, the
lower, the middle, and supreame: The lower taking light from the higher,
and the higher from the catabasse or lower with their opposite
reflexions shewing a maruellous faire light, they were so fitly disposed
by the calculate rule of the artificious Mathematrician, to the
Orientall Meridionall and Occidentall partes of the ayre, that euery
houre of the day the sunne shined in, and gaue light to the whole scale,
the same loopes or windolets in diuerse places symmetrially and
definitely dispersed and set.

To the aforesaid entrance thorow the open mouth of _Medusa_, I came by a
long gallorie to a salying scale or downe going staire opening at the
foot and pauement of the building vpon my right hand against one of the
collaterall and side-lying mountaines, betwixt which there was out of
the stone and open space cut out of tenne paces vp, into the which I
ascended boldely without resistance, and being come to the beginning of
the staire in the aforesaid mouth by innumerable steppes and degrees,
not without great wearines and disinesse of head, by often turning
about, I came to so incredible a height, that my eies would not suffer
me to looke downe to the ground insomuch, that me thought that euery
thing below vpon the plaine had lost his shape, and seemed vnperfect. In
the opening and comming out of this circulate and turning assence many
pillars of fused and molten mettall were aptly disposed and surely
fixed: the inter-space betwixt euery one and other one foote, and in
height halfe a pase, railed and ioyned togither aboue with a battelled
coronet al along the said pillar, and of the same metall compassing
about the opening of the staire, lest that any comming foorth vnawares
should fall downe headlong, For the immesurable height thereof woulde
cause a giddines in the head, and bring a staggering to the feete: vpon
the plaine of the obeliske there was infixed a table of brasse fastened
and soldered in about the height of a man, with an ancient inscription
in Latine, Greeke, and Arabike, by the which I plainely vnderstoode that
the same was dedicated to the Sunne, and the measure of the work wholy
set downe and described, the name of the Architector noted on the
obeliske in Greek letters.

    ΛΙΧΑ ΣΟΛΙΒΙΚΟΣ ΛΙΘΟΔΟΜΟΣ ΩΡΘΟΣΕΝ ΜΕ.
      _Lichas Libiicus architectus me erexit_.
      Lichas a Libian architector set me vp.

Let vs returne and come backe to the consideration of the But and
tessell or square, subiect and vphoulder of the Pyramides in the fronte
and foreside whereof I beheld ingrauen a _Gigantomachie_ and combate
betwixt Giauntes, the onely enemie to vitall breath, surpassinglie well
cut, with the quick motions and liuelie agilities of their large and
tall bodyes, vnpossible to be rightlye described, the artificiall
handling thereof, as it were enuying the woorke of nature itselfe, as if
theyr eyes and feete had mooued together, and coasted from one part to
an other, with an expedite passage and swift course. In such sorte
seemed they vpon theyr strong and mightie horsses, some being cast
downe, other stumbling and falling: many wounded and hurt, yeelding vp
their desired liues: some troden downe and mischieued vnder the feete of
the fierce and vnrestrained horsses. Other casting off their armour
wrastling and togging one with another: some headlong with their heeles
vpwarde, falling and not come to the ground from off their horsses.
Other some lying vpon the earth, houlding vp their sheilds and Targets,
offended with the one hand, and defended with the other. Many with their
shimitaries and curtilaxes, some with long swordes two handed after the
auncient Persian manner, others with diuers deadly and strange fashioned
mortall weapons: some wearing habergions and helmets, with diuers
deuises vpon their crests: others naked and vnarmed, leaping and rushing
in among the thickest, thereby shewing theyr haughtie, inuincible, and
vndaunted courages, resolute for death. Some with fearefull countenances
crying out, other shewing obstinate and furious visages, although they
were assured to dye, strongly abiding the proofe of their paine, and the
cutting in sunder of their fatall thread, others slaine before them,
with diuers vncothe and straunge warlike and deadly instruments. Shewing
their strong members, their swelling muskels standing out, offering to
the sight and eyes of tbe behoulder, the dutie of theyr bones, and the
hollownesse in the places, where theyr strong sinewes be strayned. Their
conflict and combate seemed so fearefull, bloudie, deadly, cruell, and
horrible: as if _Mars_ himselfe had beene fighting with _Porphirion_ and
_Alcion_ who made a noyse lyke the braying of Asses.

This catagliphic imagerie, did exceed a naturall and common
stature and proportion of men, carued in priuie white marble, the ground
thereof as black as iet, a perfect foile to beautifie and set forth with
pale Christaline and siluer crolley, of innumerable huge bodyes, their
last indeuours, their present actions, the fashion of their armor, the
diuersitie of their deaths, & vncertaine & doubtful victorie. The
discharge of my vndertaken discription whereof, prooueth maymed and
lame, by reason that my vnderstanding is wearie, my memorie confused
with varietie, and my sight dimmed with continuall gasing, that my
senses will not aford me rightly, and as their dewe, fitly to manifest
part, much lesse to describe at large the whole manner of their curious
_Lythoglyphi_.

After this I became to cast with my selfe, what should mooue and cause
such a pride & burning desire in any man, to fetch from far, and gather
together so mightie stones with so great trauell: With what carriage,
who were the conueyers and porters, with what manner of wheeles, and
rowling deuises, and vpholding supporters, so great large and
innumerable a sort of stones should be brought thither, and of what
matter theyr cement that ioyned and held them together, was made the
heygth of the Obelisk and statelinesse of the Pyramides, exceeding the
imagined conceit of _Dimocrates_ proposed to _Alexander_ the great,
about a worke to be performed vpon the hill _Athos_. For the strangenes
of the Egiptian building might giue place to this. The famous laborinths
were far inferior, _Lemnos_ is not to be rehearsed the Theaters of old
time were in comparison but warriners lodges, ney ther did the famous
_Nausoley_ come any thing neere. Which certainly maketh me absolutely
perswaded, that he which wrote the seauen woonders of the world, neuer
heard of this: neyther in any age hath their been seene or imagined the
like, no not the sepulcher of _Ninus_.

Lastly I woondered what foundation and arches were able to vphold so
monstrous a weight, whether the pyllars were hexagons or tetragons, and
what varietie of columnes, and what number might serue, and after what
sorte proportionately disposed and set. For the better vnderstanding and
more perfect knowledge wherof, I conueyghed my selfe in at the open &
spacious porche and enterance, within the which was an obscure and vast
hollownes: which porche, together with the proud and stately buylding
(things worthy of memorie) shall in some sorte be descrybed as
followeth.




_Poliphilus, after the discription of the huge Pyramides and Obeliske,
  discourseth of maruelous woorkes in this Chapter, namely of a horsse
  of Colos.              of an Oliphant, but especially of a most rare
  and straunge Porche._


Rightlye and lawfullye may I haue leaue to write, that in the whole
world there was neuer such an other, so pompeous, glorious, and
magnificent a peece of worke, by mans eyes seene or crediblie reported.
The woonderfull excellencie and rare straungenesse whereof, as I beheld
what with delight, and what with admiration, my sences were so
captiuated and tyed therevnto, that no other solace or pleasure, did
eyther occurre or take place in my swift flying thought.

But that when I applyed my sences to consider, and addressed my eyes
with diligent obseruation, curiouslie to ouerlooke euerie perticular
part of this sweete composed obiect, and most rare and goodly imagerie
and virgin like bodyes, without cracke or flawe, with a long drawne
breath, and somewhat opening my mouth, I set a deepe sighe. In so much
as my amorous and sounding breathing, by reason of the thicknesse of the
ayre in this solytarie and lone place, gaue an eccho, and did put me in
minde of my Angelike and extreame desired _Polia_.

O hi me that so small or anye intermission should cause that hir louely
and celestiall Idea and shape was not still imprinted in my minde, and
continued a dayly companion, in whose brest my life is resolued to
abide, and rest as vnder the protection of a most sure and approoued
shield and safe defence.

And by this way I was brought to a place where were diuers and sundrie
excellent sorts of auncient deuises and woorkemanships: first of all,
I beheld a most fayre porche, past all sence to describe (for the
incredible curiousnes thereof, as euer was built or deuised) and the
rather for that our mother toung and vulgar speeche, may not afford apt
and peculiar words, for such a piece of artificall worke.

Before this gorgeous and glorious porche, you shall vnderstand that in
the open ayre there was a fowre square court of thirtie paces by his
Diameter, paued with pure fine marble, poynted fowre square, wrought
checkerwise of diuers fashions, and sundrie best fitting coulours: but
in many places, by meanes of the ruine of the auncient walke, and olde
pillers, broken in peeces and ouergrowne.

And in the vtmost partes of the aforesaide court, to the right hand, and
the left, towards the mountaines, there was two straight rowes of
pillars, with a space betwixt for the interiect _Areostile_,[A] as the
quantities of both columnes required, the first course or order of
setting the pyllars, beginning on both sides equall to the Lymbus or
extreame part of the fronte of the porche, the space betwixt pyllars
and pillars XV. paces. Of which collumnes or great pillars, some
and the greatest parte or number were whole. With their capitels or
heads, wrought with a waued shell worke, and cyllerie or draperie, their
corners bearing out and inanulated or turned in like a curled locke of
hayre, or the vpper head of a base Viall aboue the pinnes, which straine
the stringes of the instrument to a musicall concord; with their subiect
Astragals, writhing and hanging heere and there, making the capitall
thrise so big as the bottom thereof of the columne, wherevpon was placed
the Epistile or streight beame, the greatest part decayed, and many
columnes widowed and depriued of their Capitels, buryed in ruine both
Astragals and shafts of the columnes and their bases or feete.

    [Sidenote A: A columne consisteth of his Capitell that is the head.
    Astragalus that is the subiect of the capitell next the columne.
    Hypotrachelie the shaft of the columne. And Hypothesis, that is the
    foote whereon the Columne standeth, exceeding the bignes of the
    columne.]

Fast ioyning to which order or set rowes of pillars, there grew ould
plaine trees, wylde Oliues, Pine apple, and pricking brambles. I
coniectured that it was made for to ride horses in, to trot and gallop,
the ring, to manage, carrier, and coruet in, or els some open gallerie,
couered close ouer head, vnder propt with pillers, and of a large
widenesse to walke drie in, and to take a temperate ayre in, not too
subtile.

Aboue in this great Court paued as aforesayd, in the passage towardes
the Porche, some tenne paces, I beheld a prodigious winged vaughting
horse, of moulten brasse, of an exceeding bignesse, his wings fanning
out. His hooues standing vpon a smooth plaine base or frame, fiue foote
brode, and nine feete in length, in heigth proportionable to the bredth
and length: with his head at libertie and vnbrideled: hauing his two
small eares, the one standing forward, and the other drawne back, with a
long waued maine, falling from his crest on the contrarye side: vpon
whose backe diuers young youthes assayed to ride, but not one was able
to sit stedfast, by reason of his swiftnesse and high bounding, from
whom some were fallen downe, lying wide open to the ayre, some
groueling, other falling headlong, betwixt the horsse and the earth, the
rest in vaine houlding by the hayre of his maine, some forceing to get
vp vpon him, and others indeuoring to recouer themselues from vnder his
feete.

  [Illustration]

Vpon the vpper part of the frame and base, there was infixed and fastned
with lead, a footing or thick crust, of the same mettall that the horse
was, and vpon the which he stoode, and those that were ouerthrowne did
lye, somewhat shorter and narrower then the base or subiect frame, the
whole masse or composition cast of a peece and of the same mettall,
maruelouslie founded. Lastlye you could not perceiue that any were
contented with his rowghnes, as appeared by their framed countenances,
shewing a discontent which they could not vtter being sencelesse images,
not differing otherwayes thorough the excellent conning of the
craftisman from liuing creatures, and by his surpassing imitation of
nature.

_Peryllus_ there might go put vp his pypes, and blush with his deuised
Bull, and _Hiram_ the Iewe must heere giue place, or what founders els
soeuer.

The _Pægma_ base or subiect for this metaline machine to stand vpon, was
of one solyde peece of marble (of fit and conuenient breadth, heighth,
and length, for that purpose accordinglye proportioned) full of
streaming vaines, sondry coulered, and diuerslye spotted, maruelous
pleasant to the eye, in infinite commixtures, confusedly disposed.

Vpon the brest or formost part, and end of the marble base, that was
opposite against the porch, there was a garland of greene marble, like
the leaues of bitter _Alisander_, commixt with dead leaues of
Maydenweede, of a hayre coulour, within the which there was a smoothe
round, pure, white stone, wherein was ingrauen these capitall Romaine
letters.

  [Illustration:

At the hinder end in like sort was a garland of deadly Woolfwoort, with
this inscription, _Equus infælicitatis_. And vpon the right side there
was ingrauen certaine figures, shapes, and representments of men and
women dauncing together, byformed or faced, the formost smiling, the
hynmost weeping:[A] and dauncing in a ring, with theyr armes spred
abrode, and hanfasted man, with man and woman with woman. One arme of
the man vnder that of the woman, and the other aboue, and thus closing
together, and houlding by the hands, they floung about one after
another, that alwayes still in one place, a smyling countenance
incountered a foregoing sad. Their number was seauen and seauen,
so perfectly and sweetely counterfeited with liuelie motions, their
vestures whisking vp and flying abroad, that the workman could not be
accused of any imperfection, but that one had not a liuely voyce to
expresse their mirth, and the other brinish teares to manifest their
sorrow: the said daunce was in fashion of two Semicircles, with a
seperating partition put betwixt.

    [Sidenote A: None liue in this world in that pleasure, but they haue
    also their sorowes in time.]

  [Illustration]

Vnder which Hemiall figure, there was inscript this worde TEMPVS. On the
contrary side I beheld many of greene adolescency of like proportion to
the former, and in suchlike compasse or space, the grounds of both
beautified and set foorth with an exquisite foliature or woorke of
leaues and flowers, this companie was plucking and gathering of the
flowers of sundrye hearbes, and tender bushing stalkes and braunches;
and with them diuers faire Nimphes pleasantly deuising, and sportinglie
snatching away their gathered flowers,[A] and in such sort as abouesaid
vnder the figure were ingrauen certaine capitall letters, to shew this
one word AMISSIO, conteyning the ninth part to the Diameter or the
quadrature.

    [Sidenote A: Gift vainely bestowed, in time wantonlie spent, is a
    great losse, & breedeth repentance.]

  [Illustration]

At the first sight hereof I was amased and astonished, but with better
regard & great delight curiously reouerlooking the huge founded Machine
the shape and forme of a horse made by humane industry and skill most
commendable, for that euery member without defect had his perfect
harmonie, and euery limme his desired proportion, I straight called to
remembrance the vnfortunate horse of _Scian_.

And thus helde still to beholde the same artificiall mysterie, an other
spectacle and obiect no lesse worthy to be looked vpon than the former,
offered it selfe to my sight, which was a mighty Elephant, whereunto
with a desirous intent I speedely hyed me to approch and come neere.

In which meane while on an other side I heard a mournefull noise and
humane groaning, as proceeding from a sicke body euen vnto death:
whereat I stoode still at the first, my haires standing right vp, but
presently without further stay, I addressed my steppes towards the place
from whence I heard this wofull noyse and dolefull lament, forcing my
selfe vp vppon a heape of ruinated, broken and downe-fallen marbles.
Thus willingly going forward, I came to a vast and wonderfull large
Colose, the feete thereof bare, and their soles hollowe, and the legges
as if their flesh had beene wasted, consumed and fallen away. From
thence with horror I came to looke vpon the head, where _I_ did
coniecture and imagine, that the ayre and winde getting in and comming
foorth of his wide open mouth, and the hollow pipes of his throat, by a
diuine inuention did cause this moderated noise and timed groanes: it
lay with the face vpward all of molten mettal, like a man of middle age,
and his head lifted vp as with a pillowe, with a resemblance of one that
were sicke, breathing out at his mouth, sighes and groanes gaping, his
length was three score paces. By the haires of his beard you might mount
vp to his breast, and by the rent and torne peeces of the same to his
stil lamenting mouth, which groningly remained wide open and empty, by
the which, prouoked by the spurre of curious desire, I went downe by
diuers degrees into his throat, from thence to his stomacke, and so
foorth by secret wayes, and by little and little to all the seuerall
partes of his inward bowelles, Oh wonderfull conceit. And euery part of
mans body hauing vpon it written his proper appellation in three ideomes
Chaldee, Greeke and Latine, that you might know the intrailes, sinews,
bones, veines, muscles and the inclosed flesh, and what disease is bred
there: the cause thereof, the cure and remedy, Vnto which inglomerated
and winding heape of bowelles, there was a conuenient comming vnto and
entrance in: with small loope-holes and wickets in sundry places
diuersly disposed, yeelding thorough them a sufficient light to beholde
the seuerall partes of the artificiall anothomie, not wanting any member
that is found in a naturall body.

When I came to the heart, did see and reade how Loue at his first
entrance begetteth sorow, and in continuaunce sendeth out sighes, and
where Loue doth most greeuously offend: wherewithall _I_ was mooued to
renew my passion, sending out from the botome of my heart deepe set and
groaning sighs inuocating and calling out vpon _Polia_, in such sort as
that the whole Colose and Machine of brasse did resound, striking me
into a horrible feare: an exquisite Arte beyond all capacity, for a man
to frame his like not being an Anotomy indeede.

Oh the excellency of passed wittes, and perfect golden age when Vertue
did striue with Fortune, leauing onely behind him for an heritage to
this our world, blinde, ignorant, and grudging desire of worldly pelfe.

Vpon the other side I perceiued of like bignes to the former Colose, the
vpper part of a womans head some deale bare, and the rest buried with
the decayed ruines, as I thought, of such like workmanship as the other,
and being forbidden by incomposite and disordered heapes of decayed and
fallen downe stones, to view the same I returned to another former
obiect, which was (and not farre distant from the horse straight
forward) a huge Elephant of more blacke stone than the Obsidium,
powdered ouer with small spottes of golde and glimces of siluer, as
thicke as dust glistering in the sonne. The extreame hardnes whereof the
better did shew his cleere shining brightnes, so as euery proper obiect
therein did represent it selfe, excepte in that parte where the mettall
did beare a contrary colour. Vpon his large backe was set a saddle or
furniture of brasse, with two gyrthes going vnder his large belly,
betwixt the which two being streight buckled vp with buckles of the same
stone, there was inter-set a quadrangle correspondent to the breadth of
the Obeliske placed vpon the saddle, and so iustly set, as no
perpendicular line would fall on either side the diameter. Vpon three
parts or sides of the foure square Obelisk, were ingrauen Egiptian
caracters. The beast so exactly and cunningly proportioned, as inuention
could deuise, and art performe. The aforesaid saddle and furniture set
foorth and beautified with studdes hanging iewels, stories, and deuises,
and houlding vp as it were a mightie Obeliske of greene couloured stone
of Lacedemonia, vpon the euen square, two paces broad, and seauen in
height, to the sharpe pointe thereof, waxing smaller and smaller, vpon
which pointe there was fixte a Trigon or rounde Ball of a shinyng and
glystering substance.

This huge beast stood streight vpon all foure, of an exquisite
woorkmanship vpon the plaine leuell, and vpper part of the base, hewen
and cunningly fashioned, beeing of _Porphyr_ stone. With two large and
long teeth, of puer white stone, and cleare appact, and fastned. And to
the fore gyrth on eyther side was buckled a riche and gorgeous
poiterell, beautified with diuers ornaments and varietie of Iewels, the
subiect whereof was of the same substance of the saddle: vppon the
middest whereof was grauen in Latine _Cerebrum est in capite_. And in
like manner brought about the out sides of his neck to the foretop of
his large and big head, it was there fastned together with an
artificiall knot: from the which a curious ornament and verie notable,
of Gouldsmithes worke, hung downe, ouer spredding his spacious face: the
same ornament being twise so long as broade, bordered about, in the
table whereof I beheld certaine letters, _Ionic_ and _Arabic_, in this
sorte.

  [Illustration:
  ΠΟΝΟΣ ΚΑΙ ΕΥΦΥΙΑ
  [Arabic: ....] ]

His deuouring trunke rested not vpon the leuel of the base, but some
deale hanging downe, turned vppe againe towardes his face. His rigged
large ears like a Fox-hounde flappingly pendent, whose vast stature was
little lesse, then a verye naturall Olyphant. And in the about compasse,
and long sides of the base, were ingrauen certaine _Hierogliphs_,
or Egiptian caracters. Being decently and orderlye pullished, with a
requisite rebatement, _Lataster gule thore orbicle, Astragals_ or
_Neptrules_, with a turned down _Syme_ at the foote of the base, and
turned vp aloft with writhin trachils and denticles, agreeable and fit
to the due proportion of so large a substance, in length 12. paces, in
breadth fiue, and in heigth three, the superficiall and outward part,
whereof was hewen in forme of a hemicycle.

In the hynder parte of which base and stone, wherevpon this mightie
beast did stande, I founde an assending place of seauen steps, to mount
vp to the plaine superficies of the base wherevpon the _O_lyphant did
stand. And in the reserued quadrangle perpendicularly streight vnder the
aforesaid brasen saddle, there was cut out and made a little doore and
hollowed entrance, a woonderfull woorke in so hard a substance, with
certaine steppes of brasse, in manner of stayres, by the which a
conuenient going vp into the body of the Olephant was offered me.

  [Illustration]

At the sight whereof I extreamely desired to see the whole deuise & so
going in, I assended vp to the heigth of the base wherevppon the
cauernate, hollow, vast, large and predigious monster did stand, except
that same part of the Obelisk, which was conteyned within the voyde body
of the beast, and so passing to the base. Leauing towards both sides of
the Olyphant so much space as might serue for any man to passe, eyther
towarde the head or hynder haunches.

And within from the bending downe of the chine or backe of the beast,
there hunge by chaynes of copper an euerlasting lampe and incalcerate
light, thorough the which in this hinder parte I sawe an auncient
sepulcher of the same stone, with the perfect shape of a man naked, of
all natural parts. Hauing vpon his head a crowne of black stone as iet:
his teeth eyes and nayles siluered and standing vpon a sepulcher couered
like an arke, of scale woorke, and other exquisite lyneaments, poynting
with a goulden scepter, and holding forward his arme to giue direction
to the former part.

On his left side he held a shield in fashion like to the keele of a
ship, or the bone of a horse head, wherevppon was inscript in Hebrew,
Attic, and Latine letters, this sentence that is placed on the other
side with the figure.

At which vncoth and straunge sight I stood not a little amased and
somewhat doubtfull what to imagine, turning my eyes to the contrarie
part, I sawe in like sorte an other, as before burning light, and
passing thorough betwixt the side of the beast, and the therein inclosed
part of the Obelisk, I came towards the forepart of the Olyphant, where
in like manner I found such an other fashioned sepulcher as the former,
with a stature or image standing therevpon as the other, sauing that it
was a Queene, who lyfting vp hir right arme with hir formost finger,
poynted towards that part behinde hir shoulders, and with the other shee
helde a little table fast in hir hand, in which was written in three
languages this epygram.

This noueltie worthie to be manifested, and secret riddle often to be
read ouer, was not knowen to me, so as I rested doubtfull what the
interpretation of this sophisme should signify, not daring to trie the
conclusion. But stricken with feare in this dark vnlightsome place,
notwithstanding the dimme burning lampe, I was more desirous to beholde
and peruse that triumphant porch and gate as more lawfull to remaine
there than other-where. Whereupon without more adoe, I determined to
leaue this place vntill another time, that I might more quietly at
lesure looke vpon the same, and to prepare my selfe to beholde the
woonderfull worke of the gate: and thus descending downe I issued foorth
of the vnbowelled monster, an inuention past imagination, and an
excessiue labour and bolde attempt to euacuate such a hard substance
ouer that other stones be, the workemanship within as curious as that
without. Lastly, returned cleane downe, I beheld in the Porphire laste
along the sides notably insculpt and grauen these hierogliphies.

First, the horned scalpe of an oxe, with two tooles of husbandry fastned
to the hornes.

An altar standing vpon goates feete, with a burning fire aloft, on the
foreside whereof there was also an eie, and a vulture.

After that a bason and an ewre.

A spindle ful of twind, an old vessel fashioned with the mouth stopped
and tied fast.

A sole and an eye in the bale thereof and two branches trauersed one of
Oliue, an other of Palme tree.

An Anchor and a Goose.

An olde lampe, and a hand holding of it.

An ore of ancient forme with a fruitefull Oliue branch fastned to the
handle.

Two grapling yrons or hookes.

A Dolphin and an Arke close shut.

These hierogliphies were passing well cut on this manner.

  [Illustration]

Which ancient maner of writing, as I take it, is thus to be vnderstoode.

_Ex labore Deo naturæ sacrifica liberaliter paulatim reduces animum Deo
subiectum. Firmam custodiam vitæ tuæ, misericorditer gubernando tenebit,
incolumemque seruabit._

Letting passe this most excellent rare, strange, and secret deuise and
worke: _L_et vs returne againe to the prodigious horse, whose head was
leane and little, of a small proportion and yet fitting the body, which
seemed continually staring, fieerce and impatient, the flesh in his
muscles trembling and quaking, in such sort as that hee seemed rather
aliue than a fained imitation, with this Greeke worde in his face ΓΕΝΕΑ.
There were also other great peeces and fragments of diuers and sundry
lineaments among the broken and decayed ruines, which I looked not on,
still running and sliding, time giuing me onely leaue to consider and
peruse these foure rare wonders, the porch or gate, the horse, the
Colose, and the Elephant.

Oh reuerend arthists of times past, what despite hath gotten the vpper
hand of your cunning that the same is buried with you, and none left for
vs to inherite in this age,

At length being come to this ancient porch, a worke woorthie the looking
vpon maruellously composed by exquisite rules, and by art notably
beautified, with diuers and sundry sorts of cuttings, which did inflame
a desire in me to vnderstand and finde out the lineaments and practise
of the architect. I beganne after this maner, making a square from the
two collumnes on either side in a perfect sort, in the which I tooke the
due proportion of the whole porch.

A tetragon figure A. B. C. D. diuided by three lines straight, and three
ouerthwart equally distant one from an other will make sixeteene
quadrats, then adde to the figure halfe as much more in like proportion,
diuiding the adiunct you shall finde foure and twenty squares. This
figure shall serue of credycels to make the inlepturgie and briefe
demonstration that followeth.

Draw then in the first fygure A. B. C. D. two diagons, make also in the
same two lines, and straight downe, and the other ouerthwart, which make
foure quadrats mutually intersect,

Then in the voide ouer the Isopleures make foure mediane prickes,
drawing lines from one to another, and they wil make the Rhombas.

When I had drawne this figure after this manner I straightway mused with
my selfe, what reason should mooue many of our woorkemen in these dayes
eyther to thinke well of themselues, or take the art of building in
hand, not knowing what it is? Making such grosse faults in churches and
great mens houses, defaming arte, and so ignorant, that they seeme as
though they could not consider what nature hir selfe dooth teach vs in
behoulding of hir woorkes.

And what parte soeuer is not agreeable with his principle, is foule and
naught. For take away order and rule, and what thing can any man make,
eyther beautifull to the eye, or of commendable proportion and durable:
then it must needes follow, that the cause of such inconuenient errors
doth proceed from ignorance, and hath his beginning from illiterature.
And this notwithstanding, that although the perfection of this arte
dooth not varie, & fall from his rectitude, yet the discreet and cunning
architect to grace the obiect, to the behoulders: may lawfullye eyther
with adiection or deminution, beautifie his worke, keeping whole the
sollid part, with his vniuersall composition.

I call that solid which is the bodye of the frame, which is the
principall intent, inuention, fore setting downe, and symmetrie, or dew
proportion of the building without any additions, rightlye examined, and
perfectly composed, which will manifest the skill of the workeman, and
the same afterwardes to adorne and beautifie, which adiuncts is an easie
matter. Wherein is also to be considered, the dew ordering and placing
of euery thing, and not to set a crowne vpon the feete, but vpon the
head, and so oualing and denticulating, and other cuttings of sundrye
sorts in their seuerall and best fitting places, the chiefe inuention
and disposing whereof, resteth in the rare and cunning architect, but
the labour and woorking therof to the vulgar and common sort of
mannalistsand seruants to the architect, who if he will do well, he must
in no wise be subiect to auarice.

And besides his skil he must be honest, no pratler full of words, but
courteous, gentle, bening, tractable, patient, mery & pleasant, full of
new deuises, a curious searcher into all artes, and well aduised in his
proceeding, least with rashnes he comit a fault or absurditie in his
worke, and heereof thus much shall suffice.




_After that _Poliphylus_ had at large made a demonstration of the dew
  proportion of the Gate, hee proceedeth to describe the ornaments
  thereof, and their excellencie._


I hauing beene somewhat prolix and tedious in my former purpose, it may
be that it hath bred some offence, to such as dayly indeuour to occupie
theyr sences in the pleasaunt discourses of loue. But it wyll also
prooue no whit displeasant, if with a lyttle patience, they restraine to
glutte themselues with the walowish sweetnes of deceyueable delightes,
and trye the taste of a contrarye vyand.

And for as much as the affections of men are naturally variable and
different one from an other: vpon this occasion I may bee excused. For
although that bread sometime denyed and kept backe from the hungrie
body, may cause a hard conceit, yet when it is eftsoones offered vnto
him, the mallice is forgotten, and the gift very gratefully receyued.

Nowe hauing in some sorte spoken of the right vse of architecturie, and
the direct waye and meanes by order and rule, to finde out, the set
downe deuise, and solyde bodye or grounde of the woorke, with facilitie
that beeing found out, the architector may vse sundrye deuisions in
diuerse perfections, not vnlike vnto a cunning Musition, who hauing
deuised his plaine grounde in right measure, with full strokes,
afterwarde wyll proportion the same into deuisions, by cromatycall and
delyghtfull minims crotchets, and quauers, curiously reporting vpon his
plaine song. Euen so after inuention, the principall and speciall rule,
for an Architector is a quadrature, the same deuided into smales the
harmonie and sweete consent of the building, setteth foorth it selfe,
and the conuenient adiunctes, agreeable to theyr principall.

In all which this porche was most excellent, both for the rare inuention
and woonderfull composition thereof, and the strange additions to
beautifie the same, in such sorte so exquysite, so fitly placed, and so
curiouslie cut and ingrauen, as the smallest part thereof could not bee
accused of anye fault, but the woorkman commended for the perfection of
his skill.

First vpon my right hande belowe, I beheld a stilypode or square stone,
like an aulter vnder the bases of the columnes, which hauing vpon the
vpper parte a conuenient and meet coronice, and accordingly imbowed, the
bottome and lowest part in like manner was fashioned, so as the quadrate
and aforesayd stilypode, was no broder then long, but a right
quadrangule. Which aulter (as I may tearme it) sidelong about, wrought
with leaues, hollowed vnder with a gulaterie, and wrapt ouer wirh the
same foliature and leafe worke, hemming in the smooth face or table of
the Stilypode of shining white alliblaster, polished and plaine, the
outward part of the quadrangule, equilaterally compassing about the
same, wherevpon with a woonderfull curiousnes was ingrauen a man neere
his myddle-age, of a churlish and swarffie countenance, with an vnshaply
beard, thick, and turning into his chyn, by the towghnesse of the hard
skinne, and vneasie growing out of the hayre.

He sat vpon a stone with an aporne of a Goates skinne, the hinder parts
compassing his waste, and tyed behynde with a knotte, and the neck part,
with the hayrie side next him, hung downe betwixt his legges. Before him
in the interstice of these grose and tumorus calfes, there was an anuill
fastned vpon a knottie peece of a tree, wherevpon he was fashoning of a
brigandine or habergion of burning mettall, houlding vp his Hammer, and
as it were striking vpon his worke.

And there before him was a most noble woman, hauing two fethered wings
set vpon hir delicate and tender shoulders, houlding hir sonne an
infante naked, which sate with his little hyppes vpon the large and
goodly proportioned thighes of the faire goddesse his mother, and
playing with hir, as she held him vp, and putting his feete vpon a
stone, as it had beene a little hill, with a fornace in a hollow hole,
wherin was an extreame whote burning fire.

This Ladye had hir fayre tresses curiouslie dressed vpon hyr broad and
highe forhead, and in like sorte compassing about with abundance, hir
head in so rare and delicate a sort, that I marueyled why the
Blacksmithes that were there busie at theyr worke, left not off to looke
still vpon so beautifull an obiect. There was also fast by, of like
excellent woorkemanship, a knight of fierce countenance,[A] hauing vpon
hym an armour of brasse, with the head of _Medusa_ vpon the curate or
brest plate, and all the rest exquisitely wrought and beautified, with a
bandilier ouerthwart his broad and strong brest, houlding with hys
brawny arme a halfe Pike, and raysing vp the poynte thereof, and bearing
vpon his head a high crested helmet, the other arme shadowed and not
seene by reason of the former figure: There was also a young man in
silke clothing, behynde the Smith, whome I could not perceiue but from
the brest vpwarde, ouer the declyning head of the forenamed Smith. Thys
rehearsed hystorie, for the better and sweeter pleasing to the eye, the
workeman had graced in this sort. The playne grounde that was hollowe
and smoothe in euery cutting out of a limme or body, vpon the table of
the stylipode, was like vnto red coroll and shyning, which made such a
reflection vpon the naked bodyes, and theyr members betwixt them, and
compassing them about, that they seemed lyke a Carnation Rose couler.

    [Sidenote A: Mars.]

Vpon the left side of the doore in the like aulter or stylipode vpon the
table thereof, there was ingrauen a yoong man of seemly countenance,[A]
wherein appeared great celerity: he sate vpon a square seate adorned
with an ancient manner of caruing, hauing vpon his legge a paire of half
buskens, open from the calfe of the legge to the ancle, from whence grew
out on either ancle a wing, and to whome the aforesaide goddes with a
heauenlye shape, her brests touching together and growne out round and
firme without shaking, with her large flankes conformable to the rest of
hir proportion before mentioned with a sweet countenance offered yoong
and tender sonne ready to be taught: the yong man bowing himselfe
curteously downe to the childe, who stoode before him vppon his pretty
little feete, receiuing from his tutor three arrowes, which in such sort
were deliuered as one might easelye coniecture and gather after what
manner they were to be vsed: the goddesse his mother holding the empty
quiuer and bowe vnbent, and at the feete of this instructor lay his
vypered caduce.

    [Sidenote A: Mercurie.]

There also I saw a squier or armour-bearer and a woman with a helmet
vpon her head carying a trophæ or signe of victorie vpon a speare after
this manner.[A] An ancient coate-armor hung vp, and vpon the top thereof
or creast, a spheare vpon two wings, and betwixt both wings this note or
saying, _Nihil firmum_, Nothing permanent: she was apparelled in a thin
garment carried abroad with the wind, and her breasts bare.

    [Sidenote A: Amor mi troua di tutto disarmato.]

The two straight pillars of Porphyre of seuen diameters vpon either of
the aforenamed stilipodes and square aultars did stretch vpward of a
pumish or tawnie colour, the out sides shining cleere and smoothly
pollished, chamfered, and chanelled with foure and twenty rebaternents
or channels in euery collumne betwixt the nextruls or cordels.

Of these the third part was round, and the reason of their cutting in
such sort (that is two parts chamfered, & the third round) as I thought
was this: the frame or temple was dedicated to both sexes, that is, to a
god and a goddesse, or to the mother and the son, or to the husband and
the wife, or the father and the daughter, and such like. And therefore
the expert and cunning workemen in elder time for the feminine sex, did
vse more chamfering and channelling and double varietie then for the
masculine, because of their slippery and vnconstant nature.

The cause of so much rebating was to shew that this was the temple of a
goddesse, for chamfering dooth set foorth the plytes of feminine
apparell, vpon the which they placed a chapter with prependent folding,
like vnto plyted and curled haire, and feminine dressing, and sometimes
in stead of a chapter a woman’s head with crisped haire.

These notable and faire collumnes aforesaide did rise vp in length vpon
their vnderset bases of brasse with their _Thores_ and _Cymbies_[A]
wrought with a foliature of oke leaues and acornes winding about their
chapters standing vpon their subiect _Plynths_.

    [Sidenote A: Thores and Cymbies be the outward parts of a chapter or
    head of a pillar sticking out further than the pillar wrything and
    turning in, wrought with leaues, the worke is called of caruers &
    painters draperie and celerie.]

The Chapters of the same substance of their bases, with requisite meete
and conuenient proportion aunswerable to the harmonie of the whole
worke. Such as _Callimachus_ the chiefe caruer to _Calathus_ the sonne
of _Iupiter_ did neuer performe or come neere in the erected sepulcher
of the _Corinthian_ Virgin, beautified with draperie of double
_Achanthis_.

The Plynthes whereon the chapters did stand wrought with winding and
turning workes, and in the middest, decorated with a Lillie, the bowle
garnished with two rowes of viii. leaues of Achanthus, after the Romaine
and Corinthian maner, out of which leaues came little small stalkes,
closing together in the middest of the boule, shewing foorth a fayre and
sweet composed Lyllie in the hollowing of the Abac or Plynth, from the
which the tender stalkes did turne round together, vnder the compasse of
the square Abac, much after the woorke that _Agrippa_ caused to bee
made, in the porche of his woonderfull Pantheon.

Let vs come now to the lymet and lowest parte of the doore, for
entrance, which was of a great large and harde stone, powdered with
sundry sorted spottes, white, black, and of a clay couler, and diuers
other mixtures: vppon this stood the streight cheekes and sides of the
doore, with an interstitious aspect, inwardly carued with as great
cunning as the rest. Without any signe of eyther hookes or hinges, below
or aboue.

The arche of which doore compassing like a halfe cyrcle, was wrought
curiouslye and imbowed, and as it were bounde about with laces like
beads of brasse, some round, and some like Eglantine berries of a
reddish couler, hanging downe after an auncient manner, and foulded and
turned in among the tender stalkes.

The closing together and bracing of which hemicycle or arch, worthie of
admiration, of a rare and subtile deuise, and exquisite polyture, did
thus obiect and present it selfe to my sight.

There I beheld in a hard and most black stone, an eagle displayed, and
bearing out of the bignesse of a naturall eagle, which had louingly
seazed and taken in hir foote a sweete babe in the swadling cloutes,[A]
nicely, carefully, and gently houlding the same, least that hir strong,
sharpe, and hooking pounces, should by anye meanes pierce thorough the
tender skynne of the young infant.

    [Sidenote A: The Eagle of Iupiter that carryed Ganimed.]

Hir feete were fixed about the rising vp chist of the childe, whome she
had made bare from the nauell vpwarde and downeward so as the naked
hippes might be seene betwixt the fethered thighes of the Eagle. This
little infant and most beautifull babe (worthie and meete for him that
he was seazed for) by his countenance shewed as if he had beene afraide
of his fortune.

And thus lying in the foote of the Eagle, he stretched both his armes
abroade, and with his little fat hands tooke fast hould vpon the
remigiall bones[A] of the Eagles pinions displayed, as aforesaid. And
clasping his swelling prittie legges and feete, about hir suruaighing
spreding traine, which laye behinde the rising vppe of the arche.

    [Sidenote A: The bones next the qack in the wing, whiche in a hawke
    excelleth all proportions of other birds.]

This little childe was cut of the white vayne of Achates[A] or Onix, and
the Eagle of the other vaine of the same stone called sardius which is
of black couler of some called Cordeoll, ioyning both in one selfe same
stone. Whereat I stood musing and commending to my selfe the ingenious
and apt inuention of the Arthist, in the vse of such a stone, which of
his owne nature to contrarie proportions affoorded contrarie coulers,
and in such sort as by the raysing vp of hir small plummage aboue hir
seare, hir beack halfe open, and hir toung appearing in the middest
thereof, as if she had beene resolutely intended, and eagerly bent to
haue gorged hir selfe vpon it.

    [Sidenote A: Achates is a pretious stone wherein are represented
    the figures of the nine Muses, of Venus and such like beautiful
    personages.]

The hemicicle or arche rising rownd from the vpper part of the streight
cheeke of the entrance, according to the thicknes thereof was disposed
into losenges or squares, wherein were carued Roses, theyr leaues and
branches hanging in a curious and delightfull order to behoulde, ouer
the entry of the Gate.

In the two Triangles occasioned by the bow of the arche there were two
fayre Nymphes of excellent proportions and shapes, theyr clothes which
couered theyr Virgins bodyes, giuing place for theyr legges, brests, and
armes to be bare, theyr hayre loose and flying abroad, and towardes the
brace, and knitting together of the arche aboue, they held a victorious
trophæ.

The ground of which tryangle was of black stone, the better to shew the
perfection and truthe of the mettals in the trophæs, and the beautifull
bodyes of the delycate virgins.

Aboue these mentioned partes, was the Zophor,[A] in the myddest whereof,
I beheld a table of goulde, wherein was this Epigram in Cappitall Greeke
Letters of Syluer. In thys sorte reporting.

    ΘΕΟΙΣ ΑΦΡΟΔΙΤΙΚΑΙ ΤΩ Ω ΕΡΟΤΙ ΔΙΟΝΙΣΟΣ ΥΚΑΙ
        ΔΗ ΜΗΤΡΑ ΕΚ ΤΩΝ ΙΔΙΩΝ ΜΥΤΡΙ
            ΣΥΜΠΑΘΕΣ ΤΑΤΗ.

    _Diis veneri filio amori, Bacchus, & Ceres de propriis,
        S. substantiis matri pientissimæ._

    [Sidenote A: Zophor is a border wherin diuers things are grauen.]

Eyther sides of which table was reteind and held vp with two babes or
wynged spyrits of perfect and liuelye shapes, as if they had beene
celestiall bodyes, vppon a ground of Iasul or blew Saphyrs to grace the
mettals and imagerie.

Vpon the face of the Zophor extending and stretching along ouer the
columnes of porphir stone were ingrauen certain spoiles or curates,
gorgets of mayle, vaumbraces, gauntlets, shields, Targets, head-peeces,
maces, battell Axes, spurres, quiuers, arrowes, dartes, broken launces,
curtilaxes, and other auncient instruments of warre. As well ayerie and
marine, as for the field singularly well cut, and manifesting to the
behoulder both victories, force, and triumphes, after a mortall effusion
of bloud.

Vpon this in order stood the coronice, wrought with such lyneaments as
decently concurred, and were aunswerable to the excellencie of the rest
of the worke: for other wise, as in a mans body one qualitie being
contrarie to another, sicknesse dooth follow, the humors oppressing one
an other in abundance: so in building if the adiuncts be vnaptly
disposed, and vndecently distributed there will fall out a fowle
deformitie.

For a frame and building growes weake and vnseemely wherin cannot be
found a sweete harmonie and commodulate order and concent.

Which thing many moderne ideots doe confound, being ignorant in Locall
distribution. For a cunning crafts master will in his worke shewe an
allusion or resemblance to a humaine shape and proportion beautifully
adorned in apparrell.

Aboue ouer the coronice, by an inuers gradation there were fowre
Quadratures or square Tables, two right ouer the chamfered columnes, and
channelled pyllars, and two within them. In an other deuision, betwixt
the said two contrast and inwarde tables, there stood a Nimph in hir
Anagliph[A] most rare and excellent of Orichalke or yealow Latin,
houlding in eyther hand a Torche, one of them reuersed and turned
downeward, beieng extinct and put out, and the other burning towardes
the Sunne. The burning Torche in hyr righte hande, and the extincte in
hyr left.

    [Sidenote A: Anagliph smothly chased out with the hammer and not
    carued.]

In the quadriture vppon the right side, I behelde the iealous
_Climene_,[A] with her haire trans-formed into an hearbe called _Venus_
maid, or Lady hearbe, & _Phœbus_ in a cruell indignation & wrathfull
displeasure, she following of him weeping, from whom he fled hastening
on forward hys swift horses, as one that flyeth from hys mortall and
deadly enemie.

    [Sidenote A: Clymene the mother of Phaeton.]

Vppon the Table ouer the Columnes on the left side in a curious and rare
vnusuall caruing, there was the resemblance historyed of the
vncomfortable and still mourning _Cyparissus_ holding vp hys handes and
armes toward the Sunne, and making his mone to _Apollo_ for the wounded
_Cerua_.

In the third Table nexte the last mencioned, in a worke answerable to
the presedent and former, I behelde _Leucothoe_, wickedly slayne of hyr
own Father, chaunging and transforming her fayre yong and tender flesh
into smooth barke, shaking leaues and bending wandes.

In the fourth Table, was represented the discontented & displeasant
_Daphne_, at the burning desires of the curled headed _Delius_, rendring
vp by little and little her virgins body vndefiled, towards the hote
heauens, beeing metamorphised most pyttifully into a greene Laurell.

Nowe successiuely in order ouer the afore-mencioned Tables and
quadratures in the _Zophor_, wherein these Histories were represented in
shapes, there was extended and laide ouer a Coronice denticuled & oualld
with interset stralets, betwixt the iates of the Oualls, and leafeworke
and the Imbrices with the rest that appertayneth to the setting forth of
the same (past my skill to report) without any fault or defect: and
lastly, the syme was adorned heere and there with the leaues of
_Achanthis_.

And to return to the view of the whole frame, in the disposing thereof
as aforesaide,[A] the Coronices by a perpendycular lyne were
corrospondentand agreeing with the faling out of the whol worke, the
Stilliced or Perimeter, or vtterpart of the vppermost Coronice onely
except.

    [Sidenote A: A petiment in corrupt English.]

It followeth to shew and speake of the _T_able or inward part of the
_T_rigonall: within the which, according as the extreames of the same
triangle would permit, there was presented to my view, a Crowne or
Garland of diuers leaues, fruites, and stalkes, foulded vppe and wrapte
together of a greene stone knitte in foure partes, the byndings of the
selfe same stalkes, holden by two Mermaydes, the vpper parts of them of
a humayne shape, and that vnder the nauell like a Fyshe, their one hande
vp, and the other belowe on the Garlande, their scalye tayles extending
to the nethermost corners of the Triangle, vppon the top of the Coronice
hauing at theyr extreeme partes theyr fishy winges or finnes. Theyr
faces like vyrgines, theyr tresses of haire, partly curling vppe vppon
their forheades, some turned about their heads and rowled vp, some
depending downe vppon theyr temples, and crisping and inanulating by
their eares. From betwixt their shoulders grewe their winges like
Harpies, stretching downe and extending to the foulding and turnings of
theyr tayles, vpon their monstrous flankes grew out their fynnes to
swimme withall, their beginning, their fishie and scalye substance, and
from thenceso continuing theyr nether parts downewarde.

Within the saide Garland I beheld a rough Milche Gote,[A] which a little
child did suck, sitting vnder hir side vpon his fleshie young legges one
streight foorth, and the other retract and bowed vnder him. With his
little armes houlding himselfe by the hearie and rough locks, his
countenance and eyes vpon the byg and full vdder thus sucking. And a
certaine Nimphe, as it were speaking woords, and giuing voyces of
contentment, to the Goat and bowing downe hir selfe with the left hand,
held vp one of the feete, and with the right hand putting the pappe to
the smacking kissings of the sucking infant, and vnder hir were these
letters _Amalthea_.[B]

    [Sidenote A: Iupiter.]

    [Sidenote B: Iupiters nursse.]

Another Nimphe stood against the head of the Goate, with one arme
carefully compassing the neck, and with the other shee held hir by the
horne.

In the middest stood the third Nimphe with greene bowgh leaues in one
hand, and in the other an oulde fashioned drinking bowle, more long then
broad, like a boate by a little handle. Vnder hir feete was written,
_Melissa_.[A]

    [Sidenote A: The daughter of Melissus and Iupiters nursse.]

Betwixt one and other of the three fore specified Nymphes, there were
two other hauing Cymbals in theyr handes, as it were playing and
dauncing, euery one apparrelled according to the perfection of theyr
beauties, with an artificiall performance of workmanship in the
vndertaken proportions, that they rather seemed the substances
themselues then a Lythoglyph an Imagerie, either by _Policletus_,
_Phidias_ or _Lysippus_, neyther did y^e _Anaglipts_[A] to _Artemisia_
the Queene of _Caria_, _Scaphes_, _Briaxes_, _Timotheus_, _Leocaris_ and
_Theon_, come any thing neare for the workemanship heereof seemed to
excell the cunning of any humaine Lapicidarie, caruer grauer, or cutter
whatsoeuer.

    [Sidenote A: Anaglipts are cunning carues and grauers.]

Aboue this foresayde Triangle, and vnder the vpper coronice in a smooth
plaine were these two Attic wordes in capitall Letters, ΔΙΟΣ ΑΙΓΙΟΧΙΟΝ.

This conspitious porche and gate, most woorthye to be behelde, thus
stoode of a maruelous composition, excellently disposed. If I had not
explaned the commodulation and harmonie heereof particularly, I might
haue beene blamed for my prolixitie and tediousnesse, and for wanting of
fit words, in the discription. And thus for this time heereof so much.

  [Illustration:
  ΔΙΟΣ ΑΙΓΙΟΧΙΟΝ]

It must needes follow, that all the rest of the aforesaide court on
euery side was beautifull to behold, and of stately workemanship by that
which still remained standing: as in the inward parte the naues and
columnes carrieng and bearing vp an immesurable and monstrous weight,
and Corinthies of a lesser sort, a diuine and vnknowen work abounding in
variety of perfections as proportion required and needfullnes did desire
to beare vp the burthen that was laide vppon them. Their ornature and
decking with woorkes, and deuises imitating the apparreling of princely
bodies indewed as it were with an artificiall reason. For as to a large
big and corpulent body strong legges, and broad feete, are necessarie to
beare and carry the same: so in a modulate and well composed building,
to sustaine great weights, Naues are appointed, and for beautie,
columnes, Corinthies, and slender Ionices, are set vpon them. And this
whole woorke euen after such sorte as was requisite for the harmonie
thereof, euen so it stood in an approoued excellencie.

With diuersitie of coulers, sweetlye set, and aptlye disposed, the
reflexion of one beautifing another, and all together making a gratious
obiect. Of _Porphyrit_, _Ophit_, _Numidian_, _Alabastrit_, _Pyropecil_,
_Lacedemonian_ greene, and white marble, diuerslie watered, and of
_Andracine_ with white spottes, and many others of strange sorts and
diuers commixtures.

I found one rare forme of a base, in fashion like a cushion vpon the
plynthe whereof stood two trochils or torrules, with an interposition of
Hypotracles or shaftes, and Astragals, with a supreame Thore.

Diuers places were hidden and couered ouer with winding, felted and
spreding Iuie, full of black berries, and greene soft leaues heare and
there growing vp, and hindering the inwarde obiect of the auncient
worke, with other Murall and wall weeds comming out of the chinkes and
clifts, as the bell flowre. Venus Nauill, & Erogennet, of some called
Loue, to whome he is gratefull, bushing downe againe toward the ground,
in other ryfts grew Mowse-eare, Polypodie, Adientus or Lady hayre, the
iagged and curled Cithracus the knotted Lunarie minor, Prickmaddam,
Polytricon, or goulden lockes and such like, which vse to grow in
decayed buildings, and ould stone wales, so that many woorthie peeces
were inuested and hydden from me, with such like weedes and greene
Olyues the garnishers of ruines.

There was in diuers places inestimable huge downe falles of many
columnes or rather confused piles of broken stones, and vnshapely
Culpins mounting vp from the earth.

Among which downefallen peeces I might see the remaynders of diuers
shapes of men of sundrie sortes, many naked, other some hauing their
members couered with folded and plited induments, fast sticking to their
naked proportions. Some standing vpon the left foote, others vpon the
right in a streight sort, with their heads perpendicularly, euer the
center betwixt their heeles, and some looking sidewaies in height, foure
Cubites of sixe foote.

Others standing vppon both feete, some deale distant one from an other,
and each one in a maiestie sitting in their thrones, and the rest with a
rare and modest grace in their best pleasing and appointed seates.

There also I beheld innumerable _trophæs_, spoyles of armor, and
infinite ornaments, with the heades of Oxen and Horses of conuenient
bignes, and about their hornes part of their garlands of leaues,
fruites, twigges, braunches and floures, and some about part of their
bodies, with little children riding vpon them and playing, in so perfect
a sort and wished order, as the most skilfull workemaister full of
varietie, labour, studie, and industrie, could deuise and performe. With
what care and paine his abounding skill did plainly manifest, and with
what pleasure the effect of his purpose did no whit obscure.

And with such an _Eurithmie_ or apt proportioning of members, hee did
shewe the subtiltie of the art of _Lapicidarie_, as if the substances
had not beene of the hardest marble howsoeuer, but of soft chaulke or
Potters claie, and with what conclansture the stones were couched, and
by what Artillerie, rule and measure they were composed and set, it was
woonderfull to imagine.

This was the true Art enucleating and discouering the ignorance that wee
worke in, our detestable presumption, and publike condemned errors.

This is that cleare and perfect light, which sweetly and with our
vnconstrained willes draweth our dimme sighted eies to contemplate and
behold the same. For none (vnles it be he which of set purpose refuseth
to behold it) but his eyes would dasell with continuall desire to see
it.

This is that which accuseth horrible couetousnes, the deuourer and
consumer of all vertue, a stil byting and euerlasting greedie worme in
his heart that is captiuated and subiect to the same, the accursed let
and hinderance to well disposed wittes, the mortal enemy to good
Architecturie, and the execrable Idol of this present world, so
vnworthily worshipped, and damnably adored. Thou deadly poison to him
that is infected with thee, what sumptuous workes are ouerthrowne, and
by thee interdicted.

Herewithall I beeing rauished and taken vp with vnspeakeable delight and
pleasure in the regarding of this rare and auncient venerable monument
of such a grace and admiration, that I knew not to which part to turne
me first, here and there willingly looking about, and thereat amazed,
considerately perusing ouer what the ingrauen histories presented vnto
me, as I remoued my selfe from place to place, with an vnknowne delight,
and vnreportable pleasure to beholde the same, gaping at them with open
mouth, forgetting my selfe like a young childe, neuer satisfying my
greedie eyes and vnsaciable desire to looke and ouerlooke the exquisite
perfection of the auncient worke, I was spoiled and robbed of all
thoughts whatsoeuer, the remembrance of my desired _Polia_, often
accurring, onely excepted. But with an extreeme and deepe set sigh, let
vs leaue her a litle, and returne again to our continued purpose.

  [Decoration]




_Poliphilus entring a little waye in at the described porch, with great
  delight he there also beheld how it was garnished and adorned, and
  after as he was comming out he met with a monstruous dragon whereat
  he was extreemlie afraide, and compelled to runne backe into the
  building, and at last getting foorth with much adoe hee came into a
  fertile place._


A great and commendable thing with out dout it shold be, trulie to
discribe, & from point to point, to set down the incredible work, and
vnimagined composition, of so vast a frame, and huge bignes, of so great
a buildinge with the excellencie of the entrance, in a conspicuous and
sightly place, conueniently situated, where of my delight to behold
them, did exced the greatnes of my admiration breeding in me such a
conceit so as I perswaded my self that _Iupiter_ durst not vndertake the
like to the rest of the gods, & certainly beleeuing that no workman, or
human witt could compase so huge a frame, expresse so notable conceits,
or imagine and inuent so rare deuises and so gorgiouslie to garnishe
them, in so singuler an order and simmetry, to dispose them, and without
supplement or correction perfictlye to finishe them. A rare and insolent
pride in a building. Vppon which occasion I was in some doubt and that
not a little that if the naturall historiographer had seene or heard of
this, hee woulde haue scorned that of Egipt, and the cunning and
industrie of the woorking thereof, for that heerein the sundrie and
diuers woorkes effected by many seuerall workmen seemed in the
perfections, of their dewe proportions as if they had been performed by
one himselfe.

He would also as lightlie haue regarded the skillfull cunning of
_Satirus_ the architect and other of fame, especially _Simandrus_, for
the woorke of _Memnon_, who cut the three statures of _Iupiter_ in one
stone, the feet being aboue seauen cubits long.

To this the representation of the magnanimous _Semiramis_ carued out of
the mountaine _Bagistanus_ must geue place.

And letting passe to speake of the insolent greatnes of the Piramides of
memphis, those writers at large would haue bente them selues to this
description. And leauing vnreported, the famous Theaters, Amphitheaters,
Bathes, and building sacred and prophane, carriages, of waters, and
colosses, and that of Appolline translated by_Lioculus_. Or the temple
dedicated to _Iupiter_ by _Claudius Cæser_. Or that of _Lisippus_ at
_Tarentum_, or the wonder of _Carelindius_ at the Rhodes, and of
_Xenodorus_ in France, and in Roome. And the colosse of _Serapus_ nine
cubits longe of Smarage or _Emerauldes_, or the famous Labyrinth of
_Egypt_. Or the representacion of _Hercules_ at _Tyre_.

They woulde haue accommodated their sweete styles, to the commendation
heard of as aboue all other most excellent, although the Obelisk of
Iupiter, compact of fower frustes, fortie Cubits high, fower Cubits
broade, and two Cubits thick, in his deluber within the temple dooth
manifest it selfe to be a wonderfull miracle.

Vnsaciable thus casting mine eyes, and turning vp my countenance now
this way & now that way, towards this huge & mighty frame, I thus
thought with my selfe. If the fragments and remaynder of so sacred an
antiquitie, and if the greet and dust of such a decayed monument, can
breed a stupifaction in the admiration thereof, and cause so great
delyght to behould the same, what would it haue done in chiefest pride.

After this my discourseing, reason perswaded mee to suppose, that with
in might bee the Aultar of _Venus_ for hir misticall Sacrifices and
sacred flames, or the representation of hir Godhead, or the _Aphrodise_
of hir selfe and hir little Archer, and therefore with a deuoute
reuerence, my right foote beeing set vppon the halowed lymit of the
doore, there came towards me flying a white _Horix_.[A]

    [Sidenote A: A bird of slow flight & long liuing, in old monuments
    by Augurs dedicated to Saturne.]

But I sodainlye with out any further regard or curious forcaste which
with my searching eies went in as the spatious and lightsome entrie
gaueme leaue, representing vnto me such sights as merit, and are
Condigne of euerlastinge remembrannce, in ether sydes stilled with smoth
poollishede Marble, in the middle parte where of there was impacte a
rounde table, inclaustrede and compassede about with a greene Stonne
verye pretious and accordinglie asosciated with curious workemanship.
And the opposite of verie blacke stone, scorning and contemning the
hardnes of iron, and cleare and shining as a mirror. By meanes whereof
as I passed by (vnawares) I grew afrayd at my owne shadow, neuertheles I
was by an by comforted with vnexspected delight, for the place that
occasioned my disquiet nowe offered vnto me the grounde of all sciences,
historied in a visible manifest and experte painting.

And on either sides vnder the same beautifull and most noble tables,
there were placed all a long seates of stone. The pauement neat and
cleane from dust, being made of _Ostracus_.[A]

    [Sidenote A: Ostracus be pounded shels mixed with lime, whereof a
    plaster is made to floor withall.]

And so in like manner the coloured vpper seeling was pure and voyd of
Spiders and Cobwebs, by reason of the continuall fresh ayre both entring
in and going out.

The seeling of the walles as aforesayde, mounted vp to the bendyng of
the Arche from the Chapters which stood vpon their strict and vpright
Antes euen to the vttermost ende of the entrie, which was by my
perspectiue iudgement twelue paces.

From which perpolyte ligature and fastned ioyntes, the roofe of the
entrie all the length thereof, did march with a hemicircubate flexure,
answerable to the Antes and streight sides of the afore described porche
full of varieties and exquisite representments, rarely ingrauen and of
little water monsters, as in the water it selfe in their right and well
disposed plemmyrules, halfe men and women, with their fishie tailes:
some imbracing one an other with a mutuall consent, some playing vppon
Flutes, and others vpon other fantasticall instruments.

Some sitting in straunge fashioned Charriots, and drawne in them by
swift Dolphines, crowned and adorned with water Lillies sutable to the
furniture of the garnished seates: some with diuers dishes and vessels
replenished with many sortes of fruites. Others with plentiful copies,
some coupled togither with bands, and others wrastling as they did,
riding vppon _Hipposatamies_, and other sundrie and vncoth beastes, with
a Chiloneall defence.

Some wantonly disposed, others to varietie of sportes and feastes, with
liuely indeuours and quicke motions, most singularlye well set foorth,
and filling all ouer the aforesayde arched suffite.

Along vnder the bending ryse of the entrie, I beheld a singular
woorkemanship of sundrie representments and counterfeits, in an
excellent Thessellature, bright shining lyke goalde: and of diuers other
coulers, with a border two foote broade, compassing about the turning
couer of the roofe, both vnder and aboue, and deuiding them from the
woorke, vpon the plaine sides, of so perfect and fresh coulers, as if
they had beene new set, with a naturall leafe woorke of an emerawld
greene, vppon a punice or tawnie grounde, with Flowers of _Ciantes_ and
_Phænicees_ adulterated with curious knottes and windings, and in the
conteyned space of the aforesayde sides, I sawe this auncient Hystorye
paynted.

_Europa_ a young Ladye, swimming into _Creete_ vppon a prestigious Bull.
And the edict of King _Agenor_ to his Sonnes _Cadus_, _Fœnice_, and
_Cilicia_, to finde out theyr defloured sister, which thing they could
not do, but after that they had valiauntly kylled the skalie fierce
Dragon that kepte the fayre Fountayne: and consulted with _Appollo_,
they determined with theyr followers, and agreed to builde a Cittie,
where the bellowing Heyffer should appoynte, wherevppon that countrey,
euen to this daye carryeth the name of the bellowing of a Cowe _Europe_.
_Cadmus_ builte _Athens_. The other brother_Fœnicia_. The third
_Cilicia_.

Thys woorke and musaicall painting, was rightlye placed in order, as the
beginning and end of the historie required with fictions in theyr
naturall coulers, theyr actions and degrees tightlye expressed.

On the contrarie side, I beheld in the same manner the wanton and
lasciuious _Pasiphæ_ burning in infamous lust, lying in a Machine or
frame of wood, and the Bull leaping vpon that hee knew not.

After that the monstrous mynotaure with hys vglye shape shut and
inclosed in the intricate Labyrinth. And after that the imprysoned
_Dedalus_, artificially making of winges for hymselfe, and his young
sonne Icarus, who vnhappylye not obseruing hys Fathers rule, fell downe
headlong into the deepe see, leauing vnto the same seas his name, after
his drowning. And his discreete father, being safe according to his
vowe, hanging vp his wings in the temple of _Appollo_.

Vppon the which I stoode with open mouth attentiuely gazing with my
eyes, and rauished in minde with the beautie of the hystorie, so well
disposed, so perfectly ordered, so artificiallye paynted and curiouslie
expressed, whole and sounde, without any signe of decaye, the strength
of the glutinous substance, which ioyned and held the Thessalature or
checkers, together was such and so perfect. For therein the workeman had
taken great paine and shewed a rare cunning.

And thus foote by foote I went forward bowldly, examining and behoulding
what direction and arte of painting hee had obserued with a pensiled
distribution to make whole proportions in a smoothe and flat playne.
Some lynes drawing neere to my obiect, and some seeming as they had
beene a farre of hardely to bee deserned, and yet both of a like
neerenesse. And the same againe which was hardlie to bee seene, to offer
it selfe more and more, to the iudgement of the eye, with exquisite
parergie and shadowing Waters, Fountaines, Mountaines, Hilles, woodes,
and beasts, in theyr naturall coulours, and distante one from an other,
with opposite light. And in apparrell the plyghts and fouldes so
cunninglye perfected and shaddowed that as well in that, as in all the
rest, the arte did seeme to enuye nature it selfe, and that not a little
whereat I greatly woondered.

After this manner I came to the further ende, where the beautifull
hystories finished, and beyond the same more inward the darknes was such
as I durst not enter, & comming back againe I heard among the ruines a
continuing noise like the cracking of bones or their ratling together,
whereat I stood still forgetting my fore conceiued delight being
interrupted therewith from the sweetnes of the obiects. At length I
might heare a rustling as if a dead Oxe had been dragged vpon the
ground, the noyse still approaching and comming neerer and neerer the
poarch that I was to passe out at, where I heard a great hissing of a
huge Serpent: the sodaine feare I was in, made mee past crying out for
helpe, neither did I see how to escape, but by running into the darke
and obscure vastnes whiche before I was afraide to enter into.

Oh vnhappie wretch oppressed with aduers and sad fortune, I saw in the
entrie of the doore comming towardes mee, no hurtfull _L_yon crowching
to _Androdus_, but a fearefull and horrible Dragon[A] shaking her
trisulked and three parted tongue against mee, grating her teeth, and
making a skritching or critching noyse, her squamy and scaly hide
trailing vpon the flowerd pauement, clapping her winges vpon her
wrimpled backe, with a long taile folding and crinckling like and Eele
and neuer resting. _Ohi me_, the sight was sufficient to haue affrighted
_Mars_ himselfe in the assurednes of warlike Armour, or to haue made
tremble the strong and mightie Hercules, for all his molorchied and
clubbed but. And to call _Theseus_ backe from his begunne imprese and
bold attempt, and to terrifie the Gyant _Typhon_, and to make the
proudest and stoutest heart whatsoeuer to quaile and stoope. I wished my
selfe the swiftnes of _Atalanta_, beeing but young and vnarmed, no way
able to encounter with such a poisonable force, and perceiuing his
blacke infectious breath smoaking out at his mouth. Beeing past all hope
to slip by him, I deuoutly cried for diuine helpe. And sodeinly turning
my backe, as fast as I could runne, I conueighed my fearefull bodie by
the helpe of my swift pacing feete, into the inward part of the darke
places, penetrating through diuers crooked torments, ambagious passages
and vnknowne waies.

    [Sidenote A: The Dragon is that Abaddon and Apollion, the enemy to
    mankinde.]

So that I thought to bee[A] in the inextricable frame of the prudent
_Dedalus_, or of _Porsena_, so full of wayes and winding turnings, one
entring into another, to deceiue the intent of the goer out, or in the
romthie denne of the horrible _Cyclops_, or the hollow Caue of the
theeuish _Carus_. In such sort, that although my eyes were somewhat wel
acquainted with the darkenes, yet I could see iust nothing. But was glad
to stretche out my armes forme before my face, groping about mee (lyke
one that played blynde Sym) least I should runne my face against some
pyllers, and feeling with my feete softlye before I did rest vpon them
for feare I should tumble downe into some vaulte vnder thys mighty
Pyramides.

    [Sidenote A: The darke places is ignorance, and the wisedome of this
    word which is nothing els but meere folly.]

And looking backe, whether this fearefull Dragon did still followe mee
or no, the light was cleane gone. And I remayning in a darke place, full
of sundrie turnings and crossing passages, in a greater terror and more
deadly heauinesse of minde then _Mercurie_. Making himselfe _Ibis_ and
_Apollo_, _Threicia_, _Diana_, into the lyttle byrd _Cholomene_. And
_Pan_ into two shapes. I and more afraide then euer was _Oedipus_,
_Cyrus_, _Crasus_, and _Perseus_. And more trembling then the theefe
_Thracilius_ in his beares skinne. In sorrowe more abounding then poore
_Pscyphes_. And in more laboursome daungers then _Lucius Apuleus_, when
hee heard the theeues consulting to knocke him on the head and kyll
him.[A]

    [Sidenote A: Cosby for killing the L. Browgh.]

Oppressed and laden with all these aforenamed frightes and terrors, I
began to imagine that the Dragon was flying about my head, and with the
noyse of hir scritching teeth and tearing clawes to take hould vpon me
with hir deuouring iawes: my heart giuing mee to vnderstand, that the
carniuorus Woolfe which I drempt of, was a presage of this my last
doubted end. And thus running vppe and downe like a little poore
Pismeere or Aunte, when the Partrich is scratching vpon their hillocks
and picking of them vp. With my watchfull and attentiue eares, listning
if the horrible monster with hir slimie and filthie poyson and stinking
sauour were drawing towards mee. And fearing whatsoever came first into
my thought.

Finding my selfe vnarmed, voyde of all helpe, in this mortall daunger,
and miserable perplexitie, although that death is naturally bytter and
hated, yet notwithstanding at that time, I did gratiouslie esteeme of
it, which mee thought I could suffer willinglye, but that will was
insufficient: hope still looking, and perswading mee of an vncertaine,
fearefull, and vnquyet lyfe.

Alas howe my soule and bodye were lothe to leaue one an another, the
sorrowe whereof made me vnwilling to intertaine so cruel an enemy as
death: whereupon I plucking vp a good heart, thought thus.

Shall the greatnes of my loue so sweetly set on fire, now decaie,
frustrated of anie effect, for if at this present I had been but
presented with a sight thereof, I could haue beene yet the better
satisfied.

But yet forthwith returning to the inward impression of my sweetest
obiect, stil dwelling in the secret of my heart, I fell into blobering
teares, for the losse of two so worthie iewels. That was _Polia_ and my
precious life. Continually calling vpon her with deepe sighes and
singultiue sobbings, sounding in the thicke ayre, incloystered vnder the
huge arches and secret darke couering, saying thus to my selfe.

If I die heere thus miserably, sorrowfully, and vncomfortably, all
alone, who shal bee a woorthie successour of so precious a gemme? And
who shal be the possor of such a treasure of so inestimable valure? And
what faire heauen shal shew so cleare a light? Oh most wretched
_Poliphilus_, whether dost thou go vnfortunate? whether dost thou hasten
thy steppes? hopest thou euer to behold againe any desired good? Behould
all thy gratious conceits and pleasant highe delyghtes builded in thy
apprehensiue thoughtes, through the sweetenes of loue, are deadly
shaken, and abruptlie precipitated and cast downe? Looke how thy loftie
_Amorous_ cogitations are shaken in peeces and auchilated. Ah me what
iniurious lot & maleuolent constellations, haue so perniciously driuen,
and deceitfully allured thee into this miserable obscure darknes? and
now haue despitefully ledde thee in a heape of mortal feares, and
drowning in a deepe sea of vnspeakeable sorrowes. To the vnmercifull
deuouring and sodaine gobbling vp of so filthie a monster, and to bee
rotted and disgested in the stinking intrailes of so fowle a beast, and
to bee cast out in so vile a place. Oh lamentable and vnaccustomed
death. O miserable end of my desired life. Where are my eyes? what be
they barreine? Is their humor gone? Are there no more teares left to
fall trickeling downe my blubbered cheekes? Well then I perceiue that
death is at my backe, who did euer see such a change of fortune? Behold
vnhappie and wayward death, and the last houre, and accursed minute
thereof at hande, in this darkesome shade, where my bodie and flesh is
appointed to bee a foode for so fowle a beast. What furie? what
crueltie? what miserie more monstrous can a mortall creature suffer.
That sweete and pleasant light should bee rest from them that bee aliue,
and the earth denied to them that are dead. What hoggish calamitie, and
deformed mishap, so greeuously and vntimely shall abandon from mee my
most desired and florishing _Polia_, Farewell the merror of all vertue,
and true perfection of beautie, farewell.

And thus beyond all measure tost and tumbled in such and so great
afflictions, my verie soule was vexed within me, striuing to be set at
libertie from my vnfortunate and feeble bodie, passing vp and downe I
knew not where. My legges weake, feeble, and fowltering vnder mee, my
spirites languishing, and my sences in a maner gone from mee. Sauing
that I called deuoutly vppon the omnipotent God to haue pittie vppon
mee, and that some good Angell might bee appointed to conduct mee out.
And with that beholde I discouered a little light. To the which, how
gladly I hasted, let euerie one iudge what hee would doo in such a
perplexitie.

I saw an euerlasting Lampe, burning before an Aultar that was fiue foote
high, and tenne foote broad, with the images of golde standing
thereupon, which I could not verie perfectly behold, notwithstanding the
burning Lampe, the grossenes of the ayre was such and so great an enemy
to the light.

And alwayes with attentiue eares I diligently harkened, as not yet ridde
of feare, and somewhat I saw, the dimme images and the large
foundations, and feareful vaultes, and subterraneal buttresses or
vpholders and strengthes, heare and there in infinite places
distributed, and many huge and mightie pillers, some fouresquare, some
sixe square, some eight square, aptly set vnder and approportioned to
sustaine the vast bignes of the waightie _Pyramides_.

There I hauing small delight to make anie long staie, I intended to take
an vnknowne way further in, which my vndertaken course, I espied a light
whiche so long I had wished for, comming in at a litle wicket as small
as I could see.

Oh with what ioy, and with what a glad heart, I beheld it, and with what
cheare did I hasten my steppes towards it. Perchance faster then
_Canistius_ or _Philonides_[A] my vnbrideled gladnesse and extreame
desire to come neere therevnto was such, that I reuoked and haled backe
againe the diuorse of my discontented and irkesome life, successiuely
comforting my perturbed minde and quailed hart. Somewhat refreshing and
reassuring my selfe: filling vp againe my euacuated and emptie heart,
and replenishing the same with his ould cogitations.

    [Sidenote A: Two blockish lasie lubbers, one of Melite an other of
    Athens, that thought it a great labour to eate their owne meate.]

Nowe I settled my selfe more towardes my louely _Polia_, and bound my
affections more surely to hir. Being perswaded and firmely opinionated,
that this sight was a traũce in loue, for shewing that I should dye and
lose my loue. Oh how extreamely did it vexe mee. Neyther did it refuse
or make resistance to anye sharpe and newe assaulte of loue, which in my
stroken and sore wounded heart woulde lye festering and feeding of
himselfe.

And by this time, all lets and hynderances past ouer, a spatious and
large going out was offered vnto me. Then by meanes of the cleere light
I was somwhat comforted, and reassuming and gathering together againe my
wandering thoughts, and restoring my prostrate force, my suspected and
vnknowne voyage, made me to set out in running: so as the nearer I came
to the doore, the bigger mee thought it grewe. To the which at last by
Gods wyll, _Polia_ in my amorous brest bearing a predominante vigor,
I came, not ceasing to continue forward my fast course: my hands which
before I groping helde foorth, to keepe me from running against pyllers,
I nowe vsed like a payre of Ores to hasten mee awaye.

Thus traueling on safely, I came into a verie pleasaunt sighte and
counttie, in the which I was not yet without feare, and not daring to
rest me downe, the impression of the horrible monster was so fresh in my
minde, that mee thought I still heard him behinde me, and therefore I
could not so easily forget him. But was rayther perswaded to goe on
further: first because the countrie was so fertile, pleasaunt and
beautifull. Secondly, that I might get farre enough off from the place
wherein I was so lately affrighted. That then I sitting downe, might
rest my selfe, and set my minde together againe, and forget this
conceiued dread, at my entrance in of the gate, the apparation of the
white Sorix gratiously comming againe into my reteyning memorie, an
exhortatorie prouacation, and good occasion to animate and comforte me,
because that to _Augures_ it was a gratefull and propitious signe of
good luck.

    [Sidenote A: Capillata ministra.]

At last I was resolutely perswaded to commit my selfe to the benignitie
of my good fortune, which some time might bee vnto me an officious and
bountifull handmaide, of prosperous euents.[A] And therewithall pricked
forward and prouoked to continue on my walke, whether my wearie and
feeble legges would conduct and bring mee. And yet I was (as in good
sorte became mee) somewhat doubtfull to enter into such a place, (beeing
vnknowne vnto mee) where perchaunce it was not lawfull for me to come.
Albeit that I was heerin more audacious and bould a great deale, then in
the enteraunce of the gorgeous Porche. And thus my brest fast beating,
and my minde perplexed, I saide to my selfe.

There is no cause that should lead mee to turne back againe, all things
considered: is not this a safer place, and more fit to flie from
daunger? Is it not better to hassard a mans lyfe in the light and cleere
Sunne, then to dye and sterue in a blinde darkenesse? and so resolued
not to turne backe anye more: with a deepe set sighe, I called into
memorie, the pleasure and delight that my sences had well neere lost:
for the woorke which I had seene was full of maruelous woonders, and
thinking by what meane I was depriued of them, I called to remembrance
the brasen Lyons, in Salomons Temple, which were of such fierce
countenances, as that they would bring men to forgetfulnes.

And into such an estate I was afrayde that the dragon had brought me,
that so excellent and maruellous woorkes, and rare inuentions, in a
manner vnpossible for any humaine creature to performe, worthie to be
manifested, and by my selfe diligentlye perused, should now be fled out
of my sucking remembrance, so as I should not bee able to make a true
reporte of them: but therein I contraried my selfe: neither did I finde
that I was in a Lithargie passion: But that I verrie well remembred and
helde without any defaulte in order and proportion whatsoeuer I had
seene and beheld. And that the monstrous and cruell beast was a verrie
liuelye substance, and no fiction, the like of any mortall man sildome
seene, no not of _Regulus_. The verie remembrance whereof, made my hayre
stand right vp, and foorthwith mooued me to mend my pace.

Afterward returning to my selfe, I thought thus. Heere without all
doubte (for so I imagined by reason of the glorious bountie of the
beautiful soile) is no habitation but for ciuill people, or rather for
Angles and noble personages, and a place for Nimphes to frequent vnto,
or for the Goddes and Auncients, Monarches and princes, in so much as my
perswasiue desire did prouoke forwarde my restrained pace, causing a
perceuerance in my late begun iourney. And thus as one captiuated and
subiect to the sharpe spurre of vnsatiable desire, I purposed to houlde
on whether the fayrenesse of my fortune should conduct mee, as yet but
indifferent and rather languishing.

Nowe come to behoulde a fayre and plentifull countrie, fruitefull
fieldes, and fertill groundes, I did exceedinglye commend the desire
that mooued mee first to enter into them. But especially to giue thankes
to him that had brought mee out from the fearefull place, which now I
little regarded being far enough off from it.

  [Decoration]




_Poliphilus sheweth the commodiousnesse of the countrie where-into hee
  was come, in his trauailing within the same, he came vnto a goodlie
  Fountaine, and howe hee sawe fiue faire Damsels comming towardes him,
  and their woondering at his comming hither, assuring him from hurte,
  and inuiting him to bee a partaker of their solaces._


Thus gotten foorth of this fearefull hell, darke hollownesse, and
dreadfull place (although it were a sacred Aphrodise and reuerend
Temple:) and beeing come into a desired light, louelye ayre, and
pleasaunt countrie, full of contentment: I turned my selfe about to
looke backe at the place from whence I came out, and where my life, my
life that latelye I esteemed so lightlie, was so greatlye perplexed and
daungered, where I beheld a mountaine vnnaturall, with a moderate
assention and steepe rising, ouer-growne and shaddowed with greene and
tender leaues of mastie Okes, Beeches, Wainescot Okes, Holmes, _Cerries
Aesculies_, Corke trees, Yew trees, Holly or Huluer, or Acilon.

And towardes the plaine, it was couered with Hamberries, Hasels,
Fylbirds, prune, print, or priuet, and whitened with the flowers
thereof: by coulered Xeapie, beeing red towardes the north, and white
against the Southe, Plane trees, Ashe trees, and such like, spredding
and stretching out their braunches: fowlded and imbraced with the
running of Hunnisuckles or woodbines, and Hoppes, which made a pleasaunt
and coole shade. Vnder the which grewe Ladyes Seale or Rape Violet,
hurtfull for the sight, iagged Polypodie, and the Trientall and foure
inched Scolopendria, or Hartes toongue, Heleborous Niger, or Melampodi,
Trayfles, and such other Vmbriphilous hearbes and Woodde Flowers, some
adorned with them, and some without.

So that the mouth of the darke place, out of the which I had escaped,
was in a manner within the highe Mountaine, all ouergrone with trees.

And as I could coniecture it was iust against the afore spoken of frame,
and in my iudgement it had been some rare peice of woork, more auncient
then the other, and by time wasted and consumed, now bearing Iuie and
other wall trees, and so was become an ouer growne wood, that I could
scarce perceiue any comming out, or mouth for easie passage but euen for
a necessitie, for it was rownd about compassed and enuironed with bushie
and spreeding trees, so as I was neuer determined to enter in there
againe.

In the streight passage of the valie betwixt the extensed and highe
mounting rockes, the ayre was dim by reason of the retained vapores, and
yet I was as well pleased therewith as _Apollo_ at his deuine birth.

But letting passe this hole, from the which I gat out by stooping, let
vs come on forward to the sweet liberties which I next beheld and that
was a thicke wood of Chestnuts at the foote of the hill, which I
supposed to be a soile for _Pan_ or some Siluane God with their feeding
heards and flockes, with a pleasant shade, vnder the which a I passed
on, I came to an auncient bridge of marble with a very great and highe
arche, vppon the which along winning to eyther sides of the walls, there
were conuenient seats to rest vppon, which although they were welcome to
my wearye bodie, yet I had more desire to go on forwarde, vppon which
sides of the bridge, iust ouer the top of the arche, there was placed a
porphirit table with a gorgeous border of curious workmanship, one table
on the one side and an other on the other side, but that one the left
side was of _Ophite_.

Vppon the table on my right hand as I went I beheld _Egiplie
hierogliphies_ on this sorte, An auncient Helmet crested with a
Doggeshead.

The bony scalpe of an oxe with two green braunches of trees bound fast
to the hornes. And an ould lampe. Which hierogliphis the braunches
excepted because I know not whether they were of Firre tree, Pineapple,
Larix or _I_uniper, or such like: I thus interpret.

    _PATIENTIA EST ORNAMENTVM,_
      _CVSTODIA ET PROTECTIO_
              _VITÆ._

On the other side there was ingrauen a cyrcle, then an Anchor with a
Dolphin winding about the strangule thereof, which I coniectured should
signifie this, ΑΕΙ ΣΠΕΥ ΔΕ ΒΡΑΔΕΟΣ, _Semper festina tarde_.

Vnder which auncient, sure, and faire bridge, did runne a most cleare
swift water, deuiding it selfe into two seuerall currents, the one one
way and the other an other, which ranne most colde, making a soft
continuall still noyse, in their freesed, broken and nibbled Channels,
by their eaten in and furrowed bancke, full of stones, couered ouer and
shadowed with trees, their spredding rootes appearing in the same bare,
and about them hanging _Tricomanes_, _Adiantus_ and _Cimbalaria_, and
bearded also with diuers small hayres as vse to growe about the banckes
of Ryuers.

The wood that I haue spoken of, was to looke vppon verye pleasant,
neyther ouer thick or more large in compasse than a man would wish, but
building a delightfull shadowe, the trees full of small birdes and
foules.

Right forwarde, the Bridge did extende it selfe, and leade towardes a
large plaine, resounding all ouer with the sweete chirpings, melodious
recordings, and loude singing of them. Wherein were leaping and running
little Sqirrels, and the drowsie Dormouse, and other harmeles beastes.

And after this manner as aforesayd, this wooddie Countrie shewed it
selfe, enuironed about with high mountaines as much as a man might looke
vnto, and the plaine couered all ouer with a fine varietie of sundrie
sweete hearbes, and the cleare channels of Charistaline streames,
sliding downe a long the hilles with a murmuring noyse into the leauell
vally.

Adorned and beautified with the flowing bitter Oliue, Lawrell, white
Poplar, and Lisimachia, blacke Pople, Alders, and wilde Ashe.

Vpon the hils grew high Firre trees vnarmed, and the weeping Larix,
whereon Turpentine is made, and such like.

When I had well considered of this so fruitfull and so commodious a
place for cattel and beasts to be fedde in and kept, (for it looked as
though it would desire a shepheardes company and a pastorall song) I
mused what should be the occasion, that so commodious a place should lye
vninhabited. And casting my eyes further on forward into the plaine
before mee, and leauing this fore discribed place, I might perceiue a
building of Marble, shewing the roofe thereof ouer the tender toppes of
the compassing trees. At the sight whereof, I grew wonderfully glad and
in good hope, that there yet I should finde some habitation and refuge.
To the which without delaie I hastined my selfe. And being come
thereunto, I found a building eight square, with a rare and wonderfull
fountaine: which was not altogither amisse. For as yet I had not
quenched and slaked my thirst.

This building was eight cornered, small towardes the top and leaded.
Vpon one side there was placed a faire stone of pure white Marble foure
cornered, half as long again as it was broad, which latitude as I
supposed was some sixe foote.

Of this goodly stone were exact two litle halfe pillers, chamfered with
their bases, holding vp a streight Sime, with a gule and adiected
denticulature & cordicules, or worke of harts, with their chapters vnder
a Trabet, Zophor and Coronice, ouer the which was a trigonall conteined,
in the fourth part of the stone smooth and plaine without any
workemanship in the table thereof sauing a litle garland, within the
which were two Doues drinking in a smal vessel.

Al the space vnspoken of inclusiue was cut in and euacuated, betwixt the
Pillers the Gulature and ouerthwart Trabet, did containe an elegant
Cigrued Nimph. And vnder the Syme was another quarter wrought with
Thors, Torques, Ballons and a Plinth.

Which faire Nymph laye sleeping vppon a folded cloth, lap, and wounde vp
vnder her head. An other part conuenientlie brought ouer her, to hide
that bare which was womanly & meete to be kept secret. Lying vpon her
right side with that subiected arme retract, and her open palme vnder
her faire cheeke, wherevpon she rested her head.

The other arme at libertie, lying all along ouer her left loyne,
stretching to the middle of her goodly thigh. By her smal teates (like a
yong maids) in her round brests did sprowt out smal streamings of pure
and cleare fresh water from the right brest as it had been a threed, but
from the left brest most vehemently. The fall of both of them, receiued
in a vessel of _Porphyrit_ stone, with two Receptories ioyning togither
in the same vessel, seperated and distinct from the Nimph sixe foote,
standing vppon a conuenient frame of flint stone. Betwixt either of the
receptories, there was an other vessel placed, in the which the waters
did striue togither and meete, running out at the cut and appointed
places, in the middle lymbus of their Receptories, which waters comixt
out of that vessel, vnladed themselues into a little channel sliding
away, and what with one and what with the other, al the hearbes and
flowres adioyning, and about were bountifullye benifited.

That of the left brest did spin vp so high, that it did not weat or
hinder any that would sucke or drinke of the water that streamed and
sprung out of the right brest.

And this excellent Image was so difinitelye expressed, that I feare mee
_Prapitiles_ neuer perfourmed the lyke for _Venus_, to _Nichomides_ the
King of _Caria_ which Idoll he appointed to be adored of his subiects,
although the beauty therof were such that it moued that filthie people
to fleshly concupiscence.

But I was perswaded that the perfection of the image of _Venus_ was
nothing to this, for it looked as if a most bewtifull Ladye in hir sleep
had beene chaunged into a stone, hir hart still panting and hir sweete
lipps readie to open, as if she would not be so vsed.

From hir head hir loose tresses laye wauing vppon the suppressed
couering, fowlded and plited and as it were scorning the haires of the
inglomatede cloth, hir thighes of a conueniente bignes and hir fleshie
knees somwhat bending vpp, and retract towardes hir.

Showing hir streight toes as it were incereating hir fingers to handle
and streine them, the rest of hir bodie aunswerable to the perfections
of these seuerall proportions.

And behind hir the shadowing of the leaffye _Memerill_ or _Arbut_ full
of soft small Apples and fruite, and prettye byrdes as yf they had beene
chirping and singing of hir a sleep.

At hir feet stood a satire in prurient lust vppon his gotishe feet, his
mouth and his nose ioyning together like a gote with a beard growinge on
either sides of his chin, with two peakes and shorte in the middeste
like Goates hayre, and in like manner about his flankes and his eares,
grewe hayre, with a visage adulterated betwixt a mans and a Goates,
in so rare a sort as if the excellent woorkman in his caruinge had had
presented vnto him by nature the Idea and shape of a _Satire_.

The same _Satire_, had forciblie with his lefte hand bent an arme of the
_Arbut_ tree ouer the sleepie nimphe, as if he would make hir a
fauorable shadowe therewith, and with the other hand howldinge vpp a
curtaine by one of the sides that was fastened to the body of the tree.

Betwixt the comare _Meimerill_ or _Arbut_, and the _Satire_, were two
little _Satires_, the one howlding a bottell in his hands and the other
with two snakes fowlding about his armes.

The excellencie, dilicatnes and perfection of this figment and
woorkmanshippe cannot be suffientlie expressed.

This also helping to adorne the sweetnes thereof that is the whitnes of
the stone, as if it had been pure iuorie.

I wondered also at the woorking of the clothe coueringe as yf it had
been wouen: and at the bowes, braunches, and leaues, and at the little
birdes, as if they had been singing and hopping vpp and downe vpon their
pretie feet in euerie ioynt single and pounce made perfect, and so the
S_atire_ like wise. Vnder this rare and woonderfull carued woork betwixt
the gulatures and vnduls in the plaine smothe was grauen in _Atthic_
characters this poesye ΠΑΝΤΑ ΤΟ ΚΑΔΙ.

  [Illustration:
  ΠΑΝΤΩΝ ΤΟ ΚΑΔΙ]

The thirst which I had gotten the daie before was so increased, that I
was prouoked now to slacken the same, or rather inticed with the faire
beautie of the instrument, the coolenes whereof was such, as betwixt my
lippes me thought it stirred and trembled.

And rounde about this pleasant place, and by the pipplyng channels, grew
_Vaticinium_, _Lilly conuallie_, and the flowring _Lysimachia_ or willow
hearbe, the sorrowfull Reedes, Myntes, water Parsley, Baume,
_Hydrolapathos_, or water Sorrell, and other approued hearbes, and fine
floures, a little Channel comming by a sluce from the Bridge, entering
in and vnlading it selfe, was the cause of a goodly faire Poole, broad
and large, in a verie good order, trimmed about and beautified with a
fence of sweete Roses and Gessamine. And from thence running ouer it,
dispersed it selfe, nourishyng and visiting the nexte adioyning fieldes
and grounde, abounding in all sortes of hearbes, floures, fruites, and
trees.

There grewe also great store of _Cynarie_ grateful to _Venus_, wylde
_Tansie_, _Colocassia_, with leaues like a shielde, and garden hearbes.

And from thence beholding the plaine fieldes, it was woonderfull to see
the greennes thereof, powdered with such varietie of sundrie sorted
colours, and diuers fashioned floures, as yealow Crowfoote, or golden
Knop, Oxeye, _Satrion_ Dogges stone, the lesser Centorie, Mellilot,
Saxifrage, Cowslops, Ladies fingers, wilde Cheruile, or shepheardes
Needle, _Nauens_ Gentil, Sinquifolie Eyebright, Strawberies, with
floures and fruites, wilde Columbindes Agnus Castus, Millfoyle, Yarrow,
wherewith _Achilles_ did heale _Telephus_, and the rust of the same
speares head that hurt him. Withe the white Muscarioli, bee floures and
Panenentes in so beautifull and pleasant manner, that they did greatly
comfort mee (hauing lost my selfe) but euen with the looking vppon them.
And heere and there in a measurable and wel disposed distaunce and space
betweene. In a conuenient order and sweete disposed sort by a iust line,
grew the greene and sweete smelling Orenges, Lymons, Citrons,
Pomegranettes, their water boughes bendyng downe within one pace of the
ground, couered with leaues of a glassie greene colour, of a great
height and turning downe againe their toppes, laden with the aboundance
of their floure and fruites, breathing forth a most sweet and delectable
odoriferous smell. Wherwithall my appaled heart did not verie lightly
reuiue himselfe (it might bee in a pestilent ayre and contagious and
deadly sauour.)

For which cause I stood amazed and in great doubt what to thinke or doo,
and the rather because in that place I had seene such a marueilous
fountaine, the varietie of hearbes, the colours of floures, the placing
orderly of the trees, the faire and commodious disposition of the seat,
the sweet chirpings and quiet singing of Birds, and the temperate and
healthful ayre. And which I could verie well haue been contented
withall, and the worst of them might wel haue contented me, if I had
found any inhabitant there. And somewhat I was grieued that I could no
longer abide in such a place where so many delightful sightes did
present themselues vnto mee. Neither was I aduised to my better safetie
and content which way to turne me.

Standing thus in such a suspence of minde, calling to remembraunce the
daunger that I had lastlye escaped, and the present place that I was
newlye entered into, and thinking vppon hieragliphes that I did see in
the left side of the bridge, I was in doubt, to hasten my selfe towards
any vnaduised aduers accident, And that such a monument and warning
woorthie of golden letters, should not be set in vaine to them that
passed by, which was _Semper festina tarde_. Behold of a sodaine behinde
me, I heard a rusling noyse, like the winde or beating of a Dragons
winges. Alas I knew not what it should bee. And sodeinly ispasurated and
turning my selfe about, I might perceiue vpon one side of me many
silique trees of _Aegypt_, with their ripe long coddes hanging and
beating one against an other with the winde, had felled downe
themselues, which when I perceiued, I was soone quieted, and beganne to
make sport at my owne folly.

I had not continued long thus, but I heard a singing company of gallant
damoselles comming towardes mee (by their voyces of young and tender
yeares) and faire (as I thought) solacing and sporting themselues among
the flowering hearbes and fresh coole shadow, free from the suspect of
any mans sight, and making in their Gate a great applause among the
pleasant flowers. The incredible sweetnesse of hir musicall and
consonant voyce, conueighed in the roriferous ayre, and spredding it
selfe abroade with the aunswerable sounde and delectable report of a
warbeling harpe (for the tryall of which noueltie, I couched downe vnder
the lowe bowghes of the next adioining bushes, and saw them come
towardes mee with gratious gestures) hir Maydenlie head attyred and
bound vp in fillets of glystering gould, and instrophiated redimited,
garnished ouer and beset with floured mirtle, and vpon hir snowye
foreheade, branched out hir trembling curled lockes, and about hir
fayrest showlders, flew her long tresses after a nymphish fashion
artyfitiallye handeled.

They were apparrelled in carpanticall habites of fine sylke of sondrye
coulers, and weauinges of three sorts, one shorter, and distinct from
the other. The nethermost of purple, the next of greene silke, & goulde
or tissew, and the vppermost of curled white sendall, gyrded about their
smale wastes with girdles of goulde vnder the lower partes of their
round breasts. Their sleeues of the same curled Sendall, often doubled,
which bettered and graced the subiect couler. And tyed about their
wrists with ribands of silke, tagged with Gouldsmithes woorke. And some
of them with Pantophles vpon their shooes, the vpper part of the
Pantophle of gould and purple silke, leafe worke, shewing thorough
betwixt the voyde spaces of the leaues, the fine proportion of their
prittie illaquiated and contayned feete. Their shooes comming straightly
vnder their anckles, with two lappes meeting vpon their insteps, and
closed fast eyther with Buttons or claspes of gowld after a fine manner.
Aboue the hemmes of theyr nether garments, there compassed about insteed
of gardes and imbrodered woorke of hearts, which now and then blowne vp
with the gentle ayre, made a discouerie of their fine legges.

And assoone as they were aware of mee, they left of their song and
stayed theyr nimphish gates, being amazed with the insighte, and of my
comming into this place, maruelling together, and whisperinglye
enquiring of me, one of another, for I seemed vnto them a rare and
vnusuall thing, because I was an aliant and stranger, and by chaunce
come in to so famous and renowmed a countrie. Thus they staide still,
sometimes looking downe vpon me, & again muttering one to an other, I
stood still like an image. Oh wo was me, for I felt all my ioynts quake
like the leaues of an Aspe, in a bitter winde. And I was affraide of the
presaging poesie that I had read, otherwise aduising me, whereof I now
thought to late to experience the effect thereof, and looking for no
other euent, I remained as doubtfull of the deuine vision, therewith as
much deceyued as _Semele_ with the fayned shape of the _Epidaurean
Beroe_. Alas I trembled and shooke like the fearefull hinde calues at
the sight of the tawnie Lyons roring out for hunger.

Contending and striuing with my selfe, whether it were better for me
submissiuely to kneele downe, or els to turne me about and flye from
them (for they seemed to mee by their behauiour, to courteous young
women, and besides their humanitie of a deuine beningnitie) or to
remaine still vnmoueable. At length I determined to make tryall, and put
my selfe forwarde to whatsoeuer would follow, being very well assured,
that by no means I should finde any inhumanitie or cruell dealing by any
of them, and especially, because that innocencie carryeth alwayes his
protection with him. And thus somewhat comforting my fearefull minde,
and yet restrained with shamefastnesse, knowing that I was vnwoorthily
come into this shadowie place, and solicious company of deuine and
delicate nimphes, my guiltie and troubled minde, telling mee that it was
rashly and ouer-bouldly doone, and that they were it might be,
prohibited places, and a forbidden countrie for a straining to frequent.
And thinking thus and thus with my selfe: one amongst the rest of a more
boulde and audatious spirite, very hardly spake vnto me, saying. Ho who
art thou? at hir speeche I was halfe afraide, and of my selfe ashamed,
both ignorant what to say, or howe to aunswer: my voyce and spirit being
interdicted, I stoode stone still like a dead image. But the fayre
Damsels and beautifull Nimphes well aduised, that in me was a reall and
humaine personage and shape, but distempered and afrayde, they drew all
of them more neerer vnto me, saying.

Thou young man, whatsoeuer thou art, and from whencesoeuer thou art
come: Let not our present aspects any whit dismay thee, or occasion thy
discouragement nor be no whit afrayde, for here thou shalt not finde any
cruell customes, or cause of discontent, but free from displeasures, and
therefore be not afrayde to discouer thy selfe, and tell vs what thou
art.

By this motion hauing called backe againe my forgotten and lost sences,
comforted with their faire, pleasant, and fauourable aspects, and
recouering my selfe with their sweet speeches, with a very good will I
made this aunswer vnto them.

I am the most disgraced and vnhappiest louer that the whole world can
aforde. I loue, and she whom so greatly I esteeme, and so earnestly I
desire, I neyther know where eyther she or my selfe is.

And by the greatest and most daungerous hap that can be imagined I am
come hither. And now with prouoked teares downe falling from my waterie
eyes along my pale cheekes, and bowed downe to the earth prostrating my
selfe to your virginall feete I humblie craue and sue for your
fauourable graces: whereat theyr soft and tender heartes mooued with
pittie towardes mee, and halfe weeping with mee for companie, and as it
were dutifullye striuing with theyr armes to lift mee vp from the
grounde, with sweete and comfortable speeches, they courteouslye spake
vnto me.

Wee are certainly perswaded and know full well (poore wretch) that few
or none can escape by that way which thou art come, and therefore bee
not vnthankfull to that diuine power, which hath thus preserued thee.
And now be not doubtfull or afrayde of any aduers accident or greefe to
assaile thee. Therefore quyet, comfort, and settle thy heart to rest.
For nowe thou art come as thou mayest euidently perceiue, and plainely
see, into a place of pleasure and delight, abandoning strife and
discontent. For our vniformed ages: the seate vnchaungeable, the time
not stealing away, the good oportunitie, the gratious and sotiable
familiaritie, inticingly dooth allure vs therevnto, and graunteth vnto
vs a continuall leysure. And this also thou must vnderstand, that if one
of vs be merrie and delightsome, the other sheweth her selfe the more
glad and pleasaunt, and our delectable and perticipated friendship, is
with an attentiue consideration perpetually vnyted and knitte together.
One of vs increasing an others content, to the highest degree of
delight, and moste conuenyent solace.

Thou seest also that the ayre is healthfull, the lymittes and bounds of
this place verie large: of hearbes full of varietie. Of plants diuerslie
abounding, and with fruites plentifully laden, inuironed and defended
with huge mountaines and rockes, well stored with harmelesse beasts, and
fitte for all pastimes and pleasures, replenished with all kinde of
fruites and graynes, vniuersally growing, and full of goodly fountaines.

An other said: vnderstand, vnknowne, (and yet assured guest,) good
friend, that this territorie is more fruitfull then the fertill
mountaine _Taurus_ in the aquilonall asspect, whose frame dooth swell so
much, that their clusters of grapes bee two cubits long, and that one
Figtree will beare seauentie bushels.

The third: this famous and spatious countrey, exceedeth the fertilitie
of the Hyperborean Island in the West India, or the portugalles of
_Lucitania_, nowe vsurped and tyrannized by the insolent Spanyard.

Nor _Talga_ in the _Caspian_ mountaine. The fourth affirmed in hir
commendation of that countrie, that the plentifulnesse of Egypt was but
to be accounted scarsitie, in respect of that although that it were
thought to be the garden of the world.

And the last, of a choyse countenance and sweete pronuntiation aboue the
rest, added thus much, saying.

In this fayre countrie you shall not finde any large fennie groundes, or
offensiue and sicklye ayres, or craggie and fertlesse mosses, but faire
and pleasaunt hilles, inuironed and walled about with steip and
vnpassageable rockes, and by meanes thereof, secure and free from all
daungers and feare, we want not any thing which may breed delight, and
cause a sweete content. Besides all this wee are attendant vppon a
renowned and most excellent Queene of large bountie and exceeding
liberalitie: called _Euterilyda_ of great pittie and meruelous
clemencie, ruling with great wisdome, and with a kingly gouernement,
with great pompe, in an accumolated heape of all felicitie, and shee
wyll bee greatly delighted, when we shall present thee vnto hir sacred
presence, and maiesticall sight. And therefore cast away, shake of, and
forget all afflicting sorrowe, and frame thy selfe and thy affrighted
spyrits to intertaine of our comforts solace and pleasure.




_Poliphilus feeling himselfe vnder the assurance of the five Nymphes,
  went with them to the bathes where they had great laughter in the
  deuise of the fountaine, and also by his vnction. Afterward being
  brought to the Queene Eutherillida, he did see many thinges worthie
  of regard, but chiefly the worke of a fountaine._


I Being thus curteously intreated of these gracious and pitiful Nymphes,
and hauing my safetie by them sufficiently warranted with sweet
comforts, reuiuing my decaied spirites. To whatsoeuer might seeme
grateful and pleasing vnto them, so much as was conuenient for mee, I
framed my selfe to offer my seruice. And because that they had boxes of
sweete perfumes, and casting bottels of golde and precious stone,
looking Glasses in their delicate and faire handes, and pure white
Vailes of silke plited and folded vp, and other necessaries to bee vsed
in bathing, which I offering to helpe them to beare, they refusing say
thus vnto mee: that their comming into this place was to bathe, and
therewith shewed mee that it was their pleasure that I should goe with
them, for (saide they) the fountaine is here hard by, haue you not seene
it. And I reuerently made them this answere.

Most faire Nimphes, if I had a thousande tongues and knew how to vse
them al, yet could I not render sufficient thankes for your gracious
desertes, and make requital of your great fauours, because you haue
restored vnto mee my life. And therefore if I should not consent and
yeeld vnto you my seruice and company, I might wel bee accounted of a
churlish disposition. For which cause, amongst you I had rather be a
seruant, then in an other place a Lord and commander, for that (so farre
as I can coniecture) you are the tenantes and chamberfellowes of al
delight and true felicitie.

You shal vnderstand that I did see a maruerlous fountaine of a rare and
wonderful workemanship, as neuer before my eyes did beholde, and so much
my minde was occupied in the regard of the straungenes thereof, and to
quench my great thirst, that I did looke for no further benefit.

One pleasant Nymphe spake thus merrily vnto mee saying, giue mee thy
hand, thou art verie welcome. Thou seest at this present here, that we
are fiue companions,[A] and I am called _Aphea_, and she that carrieth
the boxes and white cloathes _Offressia_. This other with the shining
Glasse (our delightes) her name is _Orassia_. Shee that carrieth the
sounding Harpe is called _Achol_, and shee that beareth the casting
bottle of precious Lyquor, is called _Genshra_. And we are al now going
togither to these temperate bathes, to refresh and delight our selues.
Therefore you also (seeing that it is your good hap to bee amongst vs)
shal bee willing to doo the like, and afterwardes with a verie good wil
wee wil make our repaire to the great Pallais of our soueraigne.

    [Sidenote A: These nimphs were his fiue sences.]

Who is most merciful, bountiful, and liberal, and willing to helpe and
further you, in your intended loues, burning desires, and high
conceites. Plucke vp a good heart, man, come let vs goe on.

With pleasurable actions, maydenly iestures, swasiuious behauiours,
girlish sportes, wanton regardes, and with sweet vvords they ledde mee
on thither, beeing vvel content vvith euerie present action, but that my
_Polia_ vvas not there to the suppliment of my felicitie, and to haue
been the sixt person in the making vp of a perfect number.

Further, I found my selfe agrieued, that my apparel vvas not conformable
to this delicious confort, but grovving into some houshold familiaritie,
I disposed my self to be affable vvith them, and they with mee, til at
last wee came to the place.

There I behelde a marueilous buildyng of a bathe eight square, and at
euerye Exterior corner, there were doubled together twoo Pyles, in
fashion of a Pyke, from the leuell of the foundation, the subiect
Areobates Circumcinct and ribbed about. And after them followed the
vtmost of like bignes from the ground of the other, with their chapters
set vnder the streight beame, with a border aboue, vnder a Coronice
going round about. Which border was beautified with excellent carued
worke, of litle naked children passing wel set forth, and equally
distant one from an other, with their handes intricately tyed and
wrapped about, and in them holding little bundels of smal greene boughes
instrophiated togither. And aboue the said Coronice, did mount vp (by an
elegant arching) an eight square Spyer, imitating the subiect. Which
from corner to corner was cut through with a marueilous workemanship of
a thousand sundrie fashions, and closed againe with quarrels of
Christal, which a farre of I did take to bee _L_eade. Vpon the top of
which arched Spyer was placed a Trygon, and from the vpper center
thereof, did ascend vp a strong steale, wherinto was ioyned an other
steale whiche was turned about, and to the same was fastened a wyng,
which with euerie blast of winde tarried about, the piping steale which
had vpon the top thereof a ball, whereupon stood a naked Boy, streight
vpon his right foote, and the left holden out. His head was hollow to
his mouth like a Tunnel, with the Orifice euacuated to his mouth, to the
which was sowdered a Trompet, with his left hand holding the _L_anquet
to his mouth, & his right hand extending towardes the middle ioynt, iust
ouer the pinyon of it the wing or fane. Al which was of thinne brasse,
excellently wel cast and guilt. Which wing, ball, and boye, with his
cheekes and countenance as if hee were sounding, with the hinder part of
his head euacunated towardes the blustring winde, as that blew, so he
sounded, and as the winde caused a strange noyse among the rods of
_Siliques_ of _Egypt_, euen so did it heare in the Trumpet. Vppon which
cause I merily thought to my selfe, that a man being alone in an
vnknowne place and out of quiet, may easilie bee afrighted with such
like strange noyses.

  [Illustration]

In that part of the building that was on the other side of the Nimph was
the enteraunce into the bathe perfourmed as mee thought by the same
Lithoglyphe, that couered the sleepyng Nimphe, vppon the phrise whereof,
were certaine Greeke Caracters, signifying ΑΣΑΜΙΝΘΟΣ.

Within there were foure seates whiche went rounde about, and one vnder
an other, and close knitte togither, wroght with Iasper and Calcedony
stone, in all kinde of colours. Two of the cõpassing about seates were
couered ouer with water, and to the vpper margine of the third. In the
corners, & in euerry corner stoode a Chorinthian Collumne of diuers
colours, waued with so pure & beautiful Iacintes as nature could
affoord, with conuenient bases and their chapters curiously made vnder
the beame, ouer the which was a _Zophor_, wherein were carued little
naked Boyes playing in the water, with water monsters, with wrastling
and childish strifes, with cunning flights and agilities fit for their
yeares, in liuely motions and sportes. Al which was beautiful ouer
compassed about with a Coronice. Ouer the which, according to the order
of the little Collumies, from the perpendicular poynt in the toppe of
the Cupul or Suffite and couer of the Bathe, there went a Tore
moderator, increasing bigger and bigger of Oke leaues, one folding and
lying ouer an other of greene Diasper hanging vppon their braunshing
stalkes gilt, which ascending vp met togither, and ioyned rounde in the
aforesaide Cupul: where was placed a _L_yons head, with his haire
standing vp round about his face, and holding a Ring in his iawes, vnto
the whiche were fastened certaine chaines Orichalke or Copper, that held
a large goodly vessel, with a great braine or lyp, and furrowed of the
aforesaide shyning substance, and hangyng two Cubites aboue the water,
the bowle of the vessel which was of Christal onely except, the rest as
the ribbes thereof and lippings, was of Asure blew, with bubbles of gold
and shining sprinkled here and there.

Not farre of, there was a cleft in the earth, the which continually did
cast foorth burning matter, and taking of this, and filling the bottome
of the vessel, they did put certaine ginnes and sweet woods which made
an inestimable suffumigation, as of the sweetest past, afterwardes
closing the same, and putting downe the couer, both partes being holow,
and the lipping and ribbing perforated and pearced through the
transparent, Christal cleare and bright, they rendered a pleasant and
diuers coulered light, by the which through the smal holes the bathes
were lightened, and the heate stil incarcerated and interdicted.

The wal equally interposite betwixt Columne, and Columne was of most
blacke stone, of an extreame hardnes and shining, incloystered about and
bordered with a conuenient border of Diasper redde as Coral, adorned
with a Lyneament and worke of double Gurgules or Verticules. In the
middle part of which table, betwixt the Collumnes, there sate an elegant
Nymph naked, as if she had been staying and attending of the stone
Gallatitis, of colour like Iuorie, the lower partes of euerie of the
said borders, circulating iustly with the bases of the Collumnes.

Oh how exsquitely were the same Images cut, that oftentimes my eyes
would wander from the real and liuely shapes, to looke vpon those feyned
representations.

The paued ground vnder the water being of a diuers emblemature of hard
stone, checkered where you might see marueilous graphics through the
diuersitie of the colours. For the cleare water and not sulphurous, but
sweete and temperatelye hotte, not like a Hotte-house or Stew, but
naturally cleansing it selfe beyond all credet, there was no meanes to
hinder the obiect from the sight of the eye. For diuers fishes in the
sides of the seates, and in the bottom by a museacall cutting expressed,
which did so imitate nature as if they had beene swimming aliue. As
barbles, lampreys, and many others, the curiousnes of whose woorke I
more regarded, then their names and natures.

The black stone of the walles was ingrauen with a leafe worke, as if it
had beene an illaqueated composition of leaues and flowers, and the
little shelles of cytheriaces, so beautifull to the eye, as was possible
to be deuised.

Vpon the doore, the interstice whereof was of stone called Gallactites,
I beheld a Dolphin swimming in the calme waues, and carrying vpon his
back a young man, playing vpon an harpe: And on the contrarie side vpon
the colde Fountaine, there was an other dolphin swimming, and
_Posidonius_ riding vpon him with a sharpe elle speare in his hand.

These histories were perfected within the compasse of one selfe same
stone, and set out in a most blacke ground. Then deseruedly I did
commend, both the archytect and the statuarie. On the other side, the
pleasant dignitie of the fayre and beautiful sporting nimphes did
highlye content mee, so as I could not compare to thinke whether the
excesse of my passed sorrow, or present solace should be greatest. And
there was so sweete a smell as Arabia neuer yeelded the like.

Vppon the seates of stone, in steed of an Apodyterie, they did
impouerish theyr apparrell, richely inuoluped, in the casting of it off,
from their celestiall bodyes. Theyr fayre tresses bound vp in nettings
of gould, wouen after a most curious sort. And without any respect at
all, they gaue mee leaue to looke vpon theyr fayre and delicate
personages, theyr honestie and honour reserued. Flesh vndoubtedly like
the pure Roses and white Snowe. Ah woe is me, I found my heart to rise
and open it selfe, and altogether to be adicted to a voluptuous delight.
Wherevpon I at that present thought my selfe most happie, onely in the
behoulding of such delights, because I was not able to resist the
burning flames which did set vpon mee in the fornace of my heart. And
therefore sometime for a refuge and succour I durst not looke so
narrowly vppon theyr inticing beauties, heaped vp in their heauenly
bodyes. And they perceiuing the same did smile at my bashful behauiour,
making great sport at me: And thereat I was glad, and contented that I
might any way occasion their pastime. But I was greatly ashamed, in that
I was an vnfit companion for such a company, but that they intreated mee
to enter in with them where I stood like a Crowe among white Doues,
which made me partly ashamed to behould, and ouerlooke such choyse
obiects.

Then _Offressia_ a very pleasant disposed piece, said vnto mee. Tel me
young man what is your name? And I reuerently aunswered them,
_Poliphilus_: it will please me well saith she, if the effect of your
conditions be aunswerable to your name. And without deceit, said the
rest. And how is your dearest loue called? Whereat I making some pause,
aunswered, _Polia_: then she replyed. A ha I thought that your name
should signifie that you were a great louer, but now I perceiue that you
are a louer of _Polia_: and presently shee added more, saying: if shee
were heere present, what would you doo? I aunswered. That which were
agreeable with hir honour, and fit for your companies. Tel me
_Poliphilus_ doest thou loue hir wel indeed? Then I setting a deepe
sigh, aunswered: beyond all the delights and cheefest substance of the
greatest and most pretious treasure in the whole world, and this opinion
hath made an euerlasting impression in my still tormented heart. And
she: where haue you lost or abandoned so loued a iewel? I know not,
neyther where I am my selfe I know. Then she smyling aunswered. If any
should finde hir out for you, what rewarde would you giue. But content
thy selfe, be of good comfort, and frame thy selfe to delights, for thou
shalt finde thy _Polia_ againe. And with these and such like pleasaunt
and gratious questions, these fayre young Virgins, sporting and solacing
themselues, we washt and bathed together.

At the opposite interstice of the beautifull fountaine without, of the
faire sleeping Nymph before mentioned, within the Bathe there was
another of statues of fine mettal, and of a curious workemanship,
glistering of a golden colour, that one might see himselfe therein.
Which were fastened in a Marble, cut into a squadrature, and euacuated
for the Images to stand in their proportions, with two halfe Collumnes
that is Hemiciles, one of either side, with a Trabet, a smal Zophor, and
a Coronice, all cut in one sollid Marble, and this peece of worke was
nothing inferior to any of the rest, which before I had seene, but with
a rare art, and marueilous inuention, both deuised and performed. In the
voyd and plaine euacuated quadret, there stood two Nimphes, little lesse
then if they had been liuely creatures, apparelled, so as you might see
somewhat aboue their knees, vppon one of theyr legges, as if the winde
had blowne it vp, as they were doing theyr office, and their armes bare,
from the elbow to the shoulder except. And vpon that arme, wherewith
they sustained the Boye, the habite that was lifted vp was reiect. The
feete of the Infant stood one in one of the handes of the Nymphes, and
the other, in the others hand. All their three countenances smiling: and
with their other handes, they held vp the Boyes shirt, aboue his nauil.

The Infant holding his little Instrument in both his hands, and
continued pissing into the hotte water, fresh coole water. In this
delicious place of pleasure, I was verie iocund and full of content, but
the same was much apalled, in that I thought my selfe a contemptible
bodie, among such beauties, and dewe coniealed into Snowe, and as it
were a Negro or tawnye Moore amongst them.

One of them called _Achoe_, verie affably and with a pleasant
countenance said vnto mee, _Poliphile_ take that Christal vessel and
bring mee some of that fresh water. I without staie intending to do so,
and thinking nothing, but to do her seruice in any sort that she would
commaund me, went to the place. And I had no sooner set my foote vpon
the steppe, to receiue the water, as it fell, but the pissing Boye lift
vp his pricke, and cast sodeinlye so colde water vppon my face, that I
had lyke at that instant to haue fallen backward. Whereat they so
laughed, and it made such a sounde in the roundnes and closenes of the
bathe, that I also beganne (when I was come to my selfe) to laugh that I
was almost dead. Afterward, I founde out the concauitie, and perceiued
that any heauy weight, being put vpon the moueable stepping, that it
would rise vp like the Keye and Iacke of a Virginall, and lift vp the
  Boyes pricke, and finding out the deuise and curious workemanship
        thereof, I was greatly contented. Vpon the Zophor was
              written in _Atthic_ letters this title
                          ΓΕΛΟΙΑΣΤΟΣ.

  [Illustration]

After our great laughter and bathing, and all hauing washed with a
thousand sweete, amorous, and pleasant wordes, maydenly sportes, and
pastimes, wee went out of the water, and leapt vp vppon the accustomed
seates, tripping on their toes, where they did annoynt themselues with
sweete Odours, Diasdasmatic, and with a Myristic liquor, or water of
Nutmegges. And they offered a boxe vnto mee also, and I annoynted my
selfe therewithall, and I founde great pleasure therein, for besides the
excellent smel and sweete sauour, it was verie good to comfort my bodie,
legges, and armes, that had been so wearied in my daungerous flight.

Afterward when we had made ourselues redy, which was somwhat long after
the manner of other women, by reason of so many gewgawes and gimmerie
whatchets, they did open their vesselles of daintie confections, and
refreshed themselues, and I amongst them, and with precious drinke. When
they had eaten sufficiently, they returned againe to their looking
Glasses, with a scrupulous examination, about their bodies, and the
attire of their heades, and dressing of their yealow curling haires
depending, and hemicirculately instrophiated about their diuine faces.
And when they had made an ende, they sayde vnto mee.

_Poliphilus_, wee are now going vnto our gratious and most excellent
Souereigne the Queene _Eutherillida_, where you shal finde and conceiue
greater delight, but the water is still in your face, whereat they
beganne to renew their laughter, without all measure at mee, glauncing
and turning their eyes one to an other, with a louely regarde. At last
they set foorth, and as they went rounde togither, they beganne to sing
verses in a Phrygial tune, of a pleasaunt metamorphosing of one, who
with an oyntment thought to haue transfourmed himselfe into a Byrd, and
by mistakyng of the Boxe, was turned into a rude Asse.

Concludyng, that manye tooke Oyntmentes to one purpose, and founde the
effecte to contrarie their expectations.

Whereat I beganne to be in a doubt, that they had sung that by mee,
because that they still smiled as they turned towardes mee. But seeing
that I perceiued no alteration in my selfe, but wel I was contented to
let them laugh on. Vpon a sodaine I founde my selfe so lasciuiously
bent, and in such a prurient lust, that which way so euer I turned, I
could not forbeare, and they as they sung laughed the more, knowing what
had happened vnto mee. And it did so increase in mee more and more, that
I knew not wherewithal I might bridle and restraine my selfe from
catching of one of them, like an eager and hotte Falcon comming downe
out of the ayre, vpon a couie of Partriges. I was with such a violent
desire prickt forwarde, which I felt more and more to increase in a
sault burning. And the more I was to that venerious desire by the
violent offers of so oportune and sweete obiects. A foode for suche a
pernitious plague, and vnexperienced burning.

Then one of these flamigerous Nymphes named _Aphea_, said vnto mee, How
is it _Poliphilus_? Euen now I did see you verye merry, what hath
altered your disposition? I answered. Pardon mee that I binde and vexe
my selfe more then a willow Garland. Giue mee leaue to destroy my selfe
in a lasciuious fire. And thereat they burst out all in a laughter and
said, Ah ha, and if your desired _Polia_, if shee were here, what would
you do, how? Alas my desire, euen by the deitie which you serue, I
beseech you put not Flaxe and Rosin to the fire, whiche burneth mee out
of all measure. Put no Pitch to the fire in my heart, make me not to
forget my selfe I beseech you.

At this my lamentable and sorrowing answere, they were prouoked to such
a loude laughter, wherin they did exceed so much, that neither they nor
my selfe with the wearines thereof could goe any further, but were
constrained to rest our selues for want of breath, vpon the odoriferous
floures & coole grasse, by meanes whereof, I became somewhat oportunely
to bee eased, my heate aswaging and relenting by little and little.

And as they thus contentedly rested themselues a while, vnder the coole
vmbrage of the leafie Trees, I beganne to bee bolde with them saying.
O you women, that are burners and destroyers, doo you vse mee thus? See
what an offered occasion I haue, which wil holde mee excused, to breake
foorth and doo violence vnto you. And thereupon somewhat boldly moouing
my selfe and fayning as if I would haue done that which by no meanes I
durst, but then with a newe pastyme and laughter they called one for an
others helpe, leauing heere and there their golden Pantoffles and
Vailes, to bee carried about with the winde, and their vesselles
neclected in the grasse, they ranne all awaye, and I after them, that I
might well perceiue that they had neither crampes nor stringhawldes or
leaden heeles, and thus continuing our pastimes a pretie space, being
somewhat pleased that I had made them to runne. I returned backe to
gather vp their Pantophles and such things as they had scattered behind
them. And comming neare to a fresh coole Riuer, they began to cease off
from laughter, and to take pittie vppon mee, and _Geussia_ behinde all
the rest, bowed her selfe downe to the water, beautifully adorned with
the bendyng Bull Rushe, water Spyke, swimmyng Vitrix, and aboundaunce of
water Symples, shee dyd plucke vp the _Heraclea_ Nympha, of some called
water Lillye or _Nenuphar_, and the roote of Aron or wake Robyn, of,
some, _Pes vituli_ or _Serpentaria Minor_.

And _Amella_ or Bawme Gentill, all whiche grew very neare togither and
not farre distant, whiche shee fauourably offered vnto mee saying, of
these whiche I haue made choyse of take, and for my freedome taste.

For whiche cause I refused the _Nenuphar_, and reiected the Dracuncle
for his heate, and accepted of the _Amella_, whiche shee had cleane
washed, by meanes whereof, within a verye short space, I founde my
venerious Lubric and incensing spurre of desire to leaue of, and my
intemperate luste was cleane gone.

And when my vnlawfull desires[A] of the fleshe were brideled, the
pleasant Nymphes came againe to mee, and as wee walked on, wee came into
a frequented place, and wonderfully fruitfull.

    [Sidenote A: Vnlawfull concupiscence blindeth a man, and driueth his
    sences from him.]

And there in a fine order and appointed distance was a waye set on
either sides with Cyprus Trees, with their corner clefted Apples, and as
thicke with leaues as their nature will suffer them, the leauell grounde
beeyng couered all ouer, with greene Vinca Peruima, or Lawreoll and
Chamme, _Daphne_, and full of his asurine flowers. Which adorned way of
a meete and conuenient breadth, did lead directly on into a greene
Closure, from the beginning of whiche walke, iust betwixt the Cyprus
Trees, to the entrance and opening of the aforesaide enclosure, was some
foure furlonges. Vnto which enclosure when wee came, I founde it
equilaterall, with three fences like a streight wall, as high as the
Cyprus Trees vpon either sides of the waye, that wee had passed along
in: which was altogither of Cytrons, Orenges and Lymonds, bushing with
their leaues one within an other, and artifitially knitte and twisted
togither, and the thicknes mee thought of sixe foote: with a Gate in the
middest of the same Trees, so wel composed as is either possible to bee
thought or done. And aboue in conuenient places were made windowes, by
meanes whereof, the bowghes in those places were to be seene bare, but
for their greene leaues which yeelded a most sweet and pleasant verdure.
Betwixt the curious twistings of the braunches and their greene leaues,
the white flowers did aboundantly shewe themselues a singular Ornament,
breathing foorth a most delectable and sweete odour. And to please the
eye, the faire fruite was in no place wanting, where it should yeelde
content. And afterwardes I might perceiue, that in the interstitious
thicknes, the bowghes (not without a wonderful woorke) were so
artificially twisted and growne togither, that you might assend vp by
them, and not bee seene in them, nor yet the way where you went vp.

At length comming into this greene and delightful grounde to the eye,
and in a mans vnderstanding woorthie of estimation, I perceiued that it
was a great enclosure in the fore front of a marueilous Pallaice of a
noble simmetriated architecturie which of this frondiferous conclausure,
was the fourth part in longitude sixtie paces. And this was the
_Hypæthri_ to walke in, for open ayre.

In the middest of this great base Court, I did behold a goodly Fountaine
of cleare water, spinnyng from the verie toppe as it were to the
foundation, whiche stoode vpon a smoothe pauement through little
streight Pypes, falling into a hollowed vessel, whiche was of most pure
Amethist, whose Diameter conteined three paces, the thicknes agreeing
therewithall, leauyng the twelfth part for the thicknesse of the brimme,
rounde about the same were carued water monsters, after the best sort
that euer any auncient inuentor or woorkeman for the hardnes of the
stone could deuise to woorke, it might bee the woorke of _Dædalus_, for
the wonderful excellencie thereof. _Pausania_, if he had seene this,
would haue taken small pleasure to boast of the standing cup which he
made to _Hipparis_.

Which same was founded vpon a steale or final Pillar of Iasper of diuers
colours, beautifully adulterating one with an other being cut in the
middest and closed vp with the cleare Calcidonie, of the colour of the
troubled Sea water, and brought into marueilous woorke, beeing lifted vp
with guttured hollowe vessels, one aboue an other, with a reserued
seperation, by artificiall and woonderful ioyntes. It stood streight vp,
fastened in the center of a Plynth, made of greene Ophite which was
rounde, and somewhat lifted vp aboue, about compassing Porphyr, some
fiue inches, whiche was curiously wrought with diuers lyneaments.

Rounde about the steale whiche helde vp the vessell, foure Harpies of
Golde did stand, with their clawes and tallented feete vpon the smoothe
Table of the Ophite.

Their hinder partes towardes the steale, one iust opposite against an
other, with their winges displaied and spredde abroad, they rested vnder
the vessell with their feminine countenances, and hauing haire vpon
their heades, from the same, it spredde downe to their showlders, their
heades vnder, and not touching the vessell: with their tayles like
Eeles, and turning rounde. And vpon their nauels, an Antique leafe
worke. These were verie necessarie for the strengthening of the Pype
within the steale and smal Pillar.

Within the middest of the wombe and bellye, or nauel of the vessel, vpon
the Subiect steale, there was proportionately raised vp of the same
vessel of _Amathyst_, a substance like a Challice, inward, or the
inwarde moulde for a Bell, so high as the vessel was deepe the middle
thereof, leuell with the brimme of the vessell.

Vppon the which was made an artificious foote set vnder the
three graces naked of fine Gold, of a common stature, one ioyning to an
other.

From the teates of their breastes the ascending water did spin out lyke
siluer twist. And euerie one of them in their right hand did holde a
copie full of all kinde of fruites, whiche did extend in length vp aboue
their heades, and at the opening, all three of them ioyned rounde into
one, with diuers leaues and fruites hangyng ouer the brimmes or lippes
of the wrythen Copies.

Betwixt the fruite and the leaues, there came vp sixe small Pypes, out
of the whiche the water did spring vp through a small hole.

And the cunning Artificer, because that hee would not trouble one Cubit
with the tuch of another. With a signe of shamefastnes, the Images with
their left handes did hide that part which modestie would not haue
seene, but accounteth woorthie to bee couered.

Vppon the brimme of the hollow vessell, whose compasse was a foote
moreouer about, then the subiacent of it, with their heades lifted vp
vpon their Vipers feete, with a conuenient and decent intercalation,
there were placed sixe little scaly Dragons, of pure shining Golde, with
such a deuise, that the water comming from the teates of the Ladies, did
fall directly vppon the euacuated and open crowne of the head of the
Dragons, afore spoken of, with their winges spredde abroad, and as if
they had been byting, they did cast vp and vomit the same water whiche
fell beyonde the roundnes of the Ophict, into a receptorie of Porphyr,
and rounde, whiche were both more higher then the flatnesse of the
pauement before spoken of: where there was a little Channell going
rounde about betwyxt the Ophit and the Porphyrite, in breadth one foote
and a halfe, and in depth two foote.

Whiche Porphyrite was three foote from the playne ouermost parte to the
Pauement, with an excellent vndiculation. The reste of the partes of the
Dragonnes, for the moderate deepenesse of the vessell did grow on,
vntill all met together, transforming the extreame partes of their
tailes into an antique foliature making a beautifull illygament with the
arule or foote set vnder the three images without any deforming
hinderance to the hollownesse of the precious vessell. And what with the
greene assayling of the compassing Orange trees, and the bright
reflections of the shining matter, and the pure water, there was such a
gratious couler, in that singular and most pretious vessell, as if the
Rainbowe and the clowdes had made theyr habitation there.

Then in the corpulent bearing out of the belly of the vessell, betwixt
one, and the other Dragons, in an equall distance, and of a most
excellent melting or casting, there stood out _L_yons heads of an
exquisite exaction, and driuing, casting foorth by a little pype, the
water that distilled from the six fistulets, placed in the copie aboue.
Which water, did so forciblie spring vpward, that in the turning downe
  it fell among the Dragons in the large vessell, where by reason
          of the high fall, and fashion of the vessel, it
                  made a pleasant tinckling noyse.

  [Illustration]

All which rare worke, by so sharpe and fine a wit composed, as this
insolent and precious vessell was, the foure perfect harpies, the
woonderfull and curious azule, wherevpon the three Images of pure gould
stood, with what Arte, ordinance, and rule, digested and made perfect:
as I am ignorant in them altogither, so much the lesse able am I to
describe the whole as it did deserue, being a woorke past any humaine
reache and capacitie to frame the like.

And I may bouldly say, that in our age there was neuer seene in stone
and mettle such a peece of woorke embost, chased, and engrauen. For it
was a woonder to see, that stones of such extreame hardnesse, as that
which was the steale to hould vppe the Vessell, should be cut and
wrought to that purpose, as if it had beene as soft as wax. A woorke
raither to bee woondered at, then vndertaken.

The square base court, (in the middest whereof stood this notable woorke
of the sumptuous Fountaine,) was paued with fine Marble of diuers
coulers and fashions. Amongst which were appact very beautifully,
roundes of Diasper, equally distant, and disagreeing from the couler of
the pauement, and the corners closed vp with leaues and Lyllies. Betwixt
the square marble pauing stones, there was a space left like a list,
which was filled vp with diuers coulered stones of a lesser cut, some
proportioned into greene leaues, and tawnie flowers. Cyanei, Phænicei,
and Sallendine, so well agreeing in theyr coulers, so glistering and
seuerly set of a diligent Xesturgie. As full of coulers as a Christall
glasse, repercust and beaten against with the beames of the sunne.
Because the circumduct and compassing coulers, meeting together in the
selfe same smoothe and cleane stones, did yeeld a reflection, no part
being faultie, eyther of the square checkers or scutuls and Trigons. But
with a smoothe and streight ordinance well ioyned together.

Whereat I remained woonderfully amased by my selfe, diligently
considering vpon the noblenes of the woorke, such as I had not beene
vsed to see, and verye willinglye I would haue beene content, to haue
made more staye in the contemplating thereof, for so the dignitie of the
worke required, but I could not because it was necessarie for me to
follow after my leaders.

Then the aspect of this sumptuous magnificient and statelye pallace, the
approoued situation thereof, the dew proportion, and the maruelous
composition in my first comming to it, did make me woonderfully
contented to view the woorthines thereof, and in continuance I was
prouoked to behould more, for which cause I perswaded my selfe, as I
might very well, that the expert builder, excelled all other whatsoeuer.
What kinde of rafters? what manner of roofe? after what sort the Parlors
chambers, closets and lodgings, were disposed? with what kind of seeling
they were enclosed and incrusted? wherewithall hanged? with what couler
and kinde of painting ouerhead? What order of columination, and what
space betwixt. No other building maye goe beyonde this whatsoeuer, but
may giue place verye well, of what kinde of Marble, and what manner of
engrauing.

There I beheld the laboures of Hercules grauen in stone with halfe the
representation standing out or bearing foorth, in a woonderfull sort,
the skinnes, statues, tytles, and trophes, What an entry, what a stately
porche, what that of Titus Cesar with his stone of Phenicea with all the
tinkering and pullishing about it, there is none whose wit is so grosse
to commend it, in respect of this, but will rather scorne to speake of
it. As for the woorthie and excellent manner of glasing the gallerie
without the pallace, the conspitious porche, the manner of building, the
arched seeling aboue head, beautified and adorned with foliature and
other lineaments of pure gould and asuer couler and excellent painting
that whatsoeuer I had seene before I made finall acount of, as not
worthie of remembrance. And beeing now come to the doore within the
porche, the going in was closed vp wth a hanging, drawne ouer before it
of gould and silke, wrought together, and in the same two images. One of
them hauing all kinde of instruments about hir, fitte and readie to goe
to worke, and the other with a maidenly countenance, looking vp with hyr
eyes into heauen.

The beautye of which two were such, and so fresh, as I looked about mee,
whether _Apelles_ had painted them with his Pensill.

And there my sportfull, faire, and pleasant companions, euerie one
putting their right handes to mine, willing to haue me in, sayde,
_Poliphilus_ this is the vsuall waye, by the which you must come into
the presence of our Gracious and moste excellent Queene.

But you cannot haue leaue to enter in here through this Curtain, before
you bee receiued of a vigilant and innocent Damosel that is the keeper
of this doore, and she is called _Cinosia_. Who hearing vs comming, did
forthwith present her selfe, and fauourably held vp the cloth, and wee
entered in.

There was a roome hung about and diuided by an other Curtaine of
excellent Arras full of Imagerie, as signes, shapes, plants, and
beastes, singularly well done.

In this place at our comming, an other curious woman came towardes vs,
called _Indalomena_, and she putting by the Curtaine, wee entered in.
And there was an other suche like roome, from the second for quantitie,
with discourses and reason marueilously wouen, with infinite knottes,
bucklinges, tyings, and old fashioned harping Irons, or Hookes, as if
they had been fastened and knit togither. In which place without any
staying, the third woman came and receiued vs very gratiously, her name
was _Mnemosina_, and shee calling vs, gaue vs free leaue to go in. Where
lastly my companions did present mee before the sacred maiestie of the
Queene _Eleutherillida_.




_Poliphilus sheweth as well as hee may, how exceeding great the
  Maiestie of the Queene was, the manner of her Residence and seruice.
  His fauourable entertainment. Howe shee marueiled at him._


When I came towardes the first doore-keeper, I was somewhat abashed, but
yet I did salute her in good sorte as became mee to doo. And shee verie
curteously badde mee come neere. And in like manner the second.

In whose gard I did see a loftie Gallery as long the content of the
Pallaice, the roofe whereof, was all painted with a greene foliature,
with distinct flowers and folded leaues, and little flying Byrdes,
excellently imphrygiated of museacall paynting, as without in the first
Court, and the stone walls seeled with Chipworkes of diuers colours.

At the last doore, the Matrone _Mnemosina_ perswaded me verie
effectually, not to doubt of any thing, but that I should stedfastly
follow the royall perswasion, and healthfull counsell of the Queene, and
perseuere in the execution thereof, for that the ende without doubt
would be to my content.

And thus hauing leaue to goe in, beholde such thinges presented
themselues to my eyes, as were lyker to be celestiall then humane.

A most stately and sumpteous preparation, in a gorgeous and spacious
Court, beyond the Pallaice neere and opposite to the other, and foure
square.

The bewtifull and precious Pauement within a checkered compasse going
about the same, there was a space of sixtie foure Squadrates of three
foote, the dyameter of euerye one: Of the which one was of Iasper, of
the colour of Corall, and the other greene, powdered with drops of blood
not to bee woorne away: and set togither in manner of a Chesse-boord.
Compassed about with a border, the breadth of one pace of a rare
inuention of woorke, with small pieces of stones, of diuers colours, and
so compacte together, as if it had beene a straunge paynted woorke
euenly cut and set by rule, that you could not perceiue the ioyning, but
smoothe and shyning, and so well framed by the Lybell and Squadrate,
that no circulating or sphæricall Instrument woulde mooue to either
sides without forcing.

About this, lastlye was an other marueylous kynde of Pauing of three
paces broad, in knottes of Iasper, Praxin, Calcedonie, Agat, and other
sortes of stones of price.

And about by the sides of the walles, compassing the sayde Court paued
as you haue heard, there were placed Settles, of the wood of Palme
Trees, of colour betwixt a yealow and tawny, passing well turned and
fashioned, couered ouer with greene Veluet, and bowlstered with some
soft stuffe or feathers easie to sit vpon, the Veluet brought downe to
the frame of the Settles or Benches, and fastened to the same with tatch
Nayles of Golde, with bossed heades vppon a plaine Siluer Nextrule or
Cordicell.

The alament of the claustering walles, were couered ouer with Plates of
beaten Golde, with a grauing agreeable to the pretiousnes of the metall.

And in the coæquated and smoothe plaine of the same walles of stone,
by certaine Pilastrelles, Quadrangules, or _L_ossenges, of an equall
dimension and distinct correspondencie in the middest of euerie one,
there were perspicuously appact rounde Iewels, bearing out and swelling
beyond the plaine leuell of the wall, after the manner of the tores of
bases, and of thicknes according to the proportion of the Losenge
wherein it stood, compassed about with greene iagged leaues, one bending
ouer an other, the tops turned toward the Iewell.

And betwyxt the Foliature and the great Iewell, another border of
pretious stones curiouslie sorted and conspicuouslie set.

And in the rest of the wall circumvallate of these bearing out rownde
Iewels, the seuen Plannets with their nature and properties, with an
Encaustic woorke were sweetly painted, which I beheld with great
delight. The rest of the wall exclusiue from the rowndnes of the Iewels
within the Pilastrels, were filled vp and bewtified with infinite
varietie of workes in siluer, and powdered with diuers inestimable
stones, singularly well cut, and of diuers fashions.

The wall on the left side was in like sort, and opposite in tundels.
Against the seuen Plannettes were there seuen Tryumphes ouer the
subiectes of the same predominent Plannettes, and in such lyke Art of
Painting as the other side.

And on the right part I behelde their seuen harmonies and friendly
aspectes, and the passage of the blood, with the qualitatiue receiuing
and retiring & circulating entrance, with an incredible Historie of the
celestiall operation accedent.

The fourth alament made the Pallaice of suche like distribution as the
other, the doore except, whiche did occupie an emptie voyde interstice.
The other sixe with a regulate correspondence, and harmonye of the rest,
in the Iewelles to the opposite and symentriall congresse of the
Plannettes, with their vertuous inclinations, were expressed in the
shapes of elegant Nimphes, with the titles and signes of their natures.

The seuenth Mediane quarter, was the forefront directlye placed against
the seuenth Iewell, representing the Planet _Soll_, whiche was set vp
more higher then the rest, by reason of the Queenes Throne.

Euerie part of matter, number, forme, and lyneament, in distribution
equally correspondent to his Lybell, the right with the left, and here
and there, with an exquisite loue, and congresse agreeing.

Of whiche moste excellent Court, euerie side was eight and twentie
paces. In this sort stood this synarie open Court, all compassed about
with fine golde, a worke rather to bee wondered at, then spoken off.

The Pilastrelles were discrepant fowre paces one from an other, with a
iust partition of seuen (a number gratefull to nature) of fine and
orient Azure, Lazull stone, passing well coloured according to his
kinde, with a bewtifull bestowing of small glymces of gold. In the fore
part of which, betwixt the seuen pilastrels, there were appointed little
slender Pillers wrought about with leaues, copies, heades with haire
like leaues, boyes their hippes and legges proportioned into brawnches,
Birdes and copies, and vesselles full of flowers, with other woonderfull
inuentions and deuises, from the top to the bottome of the Anaglyph, as
if they had grown out of the foundation, making and diuiding in sunder
the spaces, their chapters were wrought of a fashion answerable to the
rest.

Ouer the whiche did extende a streight beame with grauen lineamentes
fitting the same. And ouer that a Zophor, conteining this woorke still
throughout, that is, the bonye scalpes of Oxen, with myroll bowghes full
of berries, tyed abowt theyr hornes by a towell of linnen.

Vpon either sides of them were Dolphines, with their gilles lyke leaues,
and their Finnes and their extreeme partes of a foliature, and vpon
theyr heades and backes certaine naked boyes, getting holde of theyr
lifted vp braunching tayles, with leaues and flowers, and bending them
downe.

The head of the Dolphine hauyng a Syme, whereof the one part turned
towardes the Boye, and the other bent against the vessell with an open
gaping, and endyng in the head of a Storke, with her beake against the
open mouth of a Monster, lying with his face vpwarde, and certaine
Whorelles or Beades rysing vp betwixt his mouth and her beake.

Whiche heades in stead of haire, were couered with leaues one ouer an
other, filling the Orifice of the vessell, and from one lyp to an other,
and vnder the bowle thereof towarde the foote, there compassed a fine
towell of linnen, the endes hanging downe from the knottes, in suche an
excellent sorte as was conuenient both for the place and matter. And in
the middle ouer the heades, was the face of a childe vppon a payre of
winges.

And with suche lyke lineamentes was the Zophor adorned and couered, with
a Coronice full of excellent workemanship. Vppon the plaine toppe
whereof, by a perpendicular lyne ouer the Pillars, in the ordeining of
the squadrangalles, there were placed and framed certaine olde fashioned
vesselles, by an appointed distribution, three foote high of Calcedonie,
some of Amethist, some of Agat, some of Iasper, with their bellies
furrowed and Channelled, and cut of a rare and maruellous cunning, and
with excellent eares.

In a perfect order ouer euerie Iewell aboue the Coronice, were aptlye
ioyned traunsomes, squared seuen foote high, and the middle space
betweene them of glistering Golde, with a superadiect extention, closing
ouer the streight extended transomes. And by a turnyng downe the
transomes, did ioyne decently one with the other, with a Topiarie[A]
woorke. Intending that out of the vesselles standing vpon the Coronice
as aforesaide, in the cornes the transome and the vyne should ryse vp
togither, but out of the other vesselles, either a vyne or some Woodbine
of Golde, by courses meeting ouer the transwerst traunsomes, with a
thicke stretching out of theyr spreadyng braunches, one ioyning with an
other, and twisting togither with a fine and pleasant congresse,
couering ouer all the whole court with a riche and inestimable suffite,
with diuers fashioned leaues of greene emeralde, gratefull to the sight,
more perfect then that wherein _Amenon_ was impressed, and the flowers
dispersed and distributed of Saphires and byrrals. And with an excellent
disposition and artificiall, betwixt the greene leaues and the grosse
vaynes, so precious hunge downe the clusters of grapes made of stones,
agreeable and fitting to the naturall coulers of Grapes.

    [Sidenote A: Topiaria, the feate of making Images or Arbours in
    Trees.]

All which most rare deuises, of pryse incomparable, incredible, and past
imagination, did shine all ouer most pretiouslie: not so much to be
marueyled at for the costlinesse of the matter, but for the large
greatnesse of the worke.

For nor without great cause, from place to place, with a diligent and
iealous examination I did carefully consider the large extention of the
inmost intricate braunches, and their proportionate strength and
thicknesse, so cunninglie doone, by such an arte, boulde attempt, and
continued intent, they were so aptly led out, whether by sowdering,
or by the Hammer, or by casting, or by all three, mee thought it an
vnpossible worke to make a couering of such a breadth, and so twysted
and twyned together.

In the middle prospect, oppossite against our going in vpon a degreed
regall throne, set full of glystering stones in a maruelous order, farre
more excellent then the seat in the temple of _Hercules_ at _Tyre_, of
the stone _Eusebes_. The Queene with an imperiall Maiestie sitting vppon
it, goddesse like, and of a woonderfull magnanimitie in countenance:
gorgiously apparrelled in clothe of goulde, with a sumptuous and curious
attyre, vpon hir head of a purple couler, with an edging of Orient
Pearle, shadowing ouer hir large forhead, aunciently and princelike,
euer pressing hir plemmirrulate trammels of hayre, as blacke as iet
descending downe hir snowie temples, and the rest of the aboundance of
hir long hayre, fastned rounde in the hinder parte of her head, and
deuided into two partes or tresses, lapt about this waye and that waye,
behind hir small eares, ouer hir streight proportioned head, and
finished in the crowne, with a flower of great Orient, and rownd
Pearles, such as be found in the Indian promontorie _Perimula_.

The rest of hir long spreding hayre was not seene, but couered ouer with
a thinne vayle, edged with gould, hanging downe from the said flower and
knot of pearle, to hir delicate shoulders, and flingering abroade with
the ayre.

In the middle of the edging of hir dressing, vpon the highest parte ouer
the middest of hir forhead hoong a rare iewell. And about hir round and
snowie neck, went an inestimable Carkenet with a pendent ouer the
diuision of hir rownde brests, of a table Dyamond, in fashion of an
Egge, sparkling, and of a monstrous largenes, set in gould with wyer
woorke.

At hir eares moste richelye were hanged in the typpes two earinges, two
great shynyng Carbunckles of an inestimable price.

Hir shooes were of greene silke, and hir pantofles of gould imbrodered
in a leafe woorke. Vppon a foote stoole aboue the which, and vnder hir
feete, was layde a cushion of white Veluet, with a purseling of silke
and Orient Pearles of _Arabia_, within the persick golph, with foure
Buttons wrought with pretious Stones, and tasseld with goulde twist, and
crimosen silke, depending.

Vppon eyther sides along vpon the aforesaid benches couered ouer with
greene veluet, sate hir Ladyes of honour, attendant in a goodly and
commendable order, according to their estates, apparrelled in clothe of
goulde in an incredible brauerie, as in the world may bee seene. And in
the middest of them this renowned and famous Queene in great pompe and
vnspeakeable statelynes, and the hemmes of hir vestures so edged and set
with pearle and stone, as if nature had rayned and powred them down vpon
hir.

At hir high and imperiall aspect, with great reuerence bowing their
knees to the ground vnto hir, hir women did rise vppe from their seates,
occasioned by the noueltie of the spectacle, & greatly marueiling that I
should come into such a place.

But I founde my selfe more amazed, my hearte quayling, and dilating both
of the troubles that I passed, and the present estate that I was brought
into, which did enuiron and fill me with an extreame amasement, reuerend
feare, and honest shamefastnesse.

And they asking the fiue Nimphes that brought me in, whysperinglie what
I was, and the strangenesse of my hap, directing, bending and
intentiuely fixing all their eyes vpon me. Where finding my selfe so
base a worme in such an excellent conspect, I was woonderfully
astonished, and lyke one that had no spyrite.

But the successe and manner of my comming being demaunded of them, the
Nymphes plainly, open and manifest the same at large, whereat the
gratious Queene beeing mooued to compassion, caused me to stand vp, and
vnderstanding what my name was, began to say.

_Poliphilus_, be of good comfort, and pluck vp a good heart, and tell me
how thou commest hither, and by what meanes, and how thou diddest escape
that mortall and horrible Dragon? and how thou diddest finde away out of
that odious and blinde darkenes, I haue beene tould of it: But I maruell
me not a little, because few or none dare aduenture that waye. But
seeing that grace hath safelye brought thee hither vnto vs, I will not
denye thee (any cause notwithstanding) a gratious and fauourable
intertaynement.

To whose liberall inuiting, royall woordes and intertaynement, better
then I could haue imagined to desire, with diuote and honourable
thankes, giuen aboundantly from pointe to pointe, I tould how I escaped
and fled from the Dragon, a fearefull monster. And consequently with
what trauell and payne I came to the desired place. And how the fiue
Nimphes did finde me wandering and afrayde. Which when I had at large
declared and ended my speeche, I began with great desire to frame my
selfe to bee a pertaker of their solacious and magnificent pleasures.

After that she said vnto me with a smiling and pleasant countenance.
It is a woorthie matter to consider, that an euill and discontented
beginning, often time falleth out to a happie and good successe in the
end: and before that anye thing bee committed vnto you to perfourme, as
touching your amorous and firme conceit, it is our pleasure, for the
asswagement and mitigation of thy commendable griefes, that in this
company thou especially shouldest associate thy selfe with _Philotesia_,
seeing that the faire heauens haue shewed thee of thy entertainment, and
brought thee into our triumphant mansion place. And therefore my
_Poliphilus_, without any more ceremonies take thy place there and sit
downe, for thou shalt see (with a verie good will) part of our sumptuous
and stately manner of seruice, the plentifull diuersitie and number of
my more then princely dainties, the honourable attendance of my
houshold, & excellent order thereof, the inestimable pretiousnes of my
great aboundance, and the large effects of my bounty.

At which imperious commaund, her eloquent and fauorable speech ended,
humbly, and with a little more audacitie than before, vppon one of the
benches of my right hande I did sit downe (lapping my torne gowne
together before me with certaine brymble leaues still sticking in it)
betwixt the fiue Nymphes that brought mee in, and amongst them next vnto
_Offresia_ and _Achoe_, placed behinde the Queene, and six other of the
chamber vppon the other hande, and in the middest on high vppon a throne
did the Queene sitte in an imperiall Maiestie.

The Couer ouer the Throne was of an inamelled couloring contayning in it
a beautifull image without any beard, the head bushing with yellow
haire, part of his brest couered with a thinne cloath ouer the displayed
winges of an Eagle, her head turning vp, and beholding of him. The head
of which image was redymited with an azure Diademe, adorned with seauen
beames, and at the foot of the Eagle two braunches of greene Lawrell,
one one way, the other contrary towards either side. And in euerie
garland I behelde the figment proper to his planet, and behind at my
backe was the iewell, containing the historie of the winged Mercury, and
howe the benignitie of his good disposition is depraued, when he is in
the malignant taile of the venemous Scorpion. And looking vpon my selfe,
I was ashamed to see my vile habite among suche sumpteous induments,
that me thought my selfe no otherwaies but euen lyke that vile and
mortiferous beast among the most noble signes of the Zodiac. The
bewtifull and honorable damosels sate in order vpon the Benches, compast
about all along by the sides of the walles vppon the right side, and the
best of the Court, with a rare and strange kinde of womanly dressing
vppon their heads, as is in the world, with the tresses of their haire
lapt and bowed vp in Caules of gold.

Some with their haires of Amber colour, curled and dressed vp with
flowers of the same vppon a wyer, with the endes turning downe and
wauing vppon their snowy foreheades and smooth temples, bewtified with
Rubies and Diamonds prickt in the haire.

Others of the colour of the Obsidium of _India_, blacke and shining,
adorned with floures of Orient Pearle, & Carkenets of the same. They
stood all waiting with such a venerate attention, that when the seruice
was brought to the table, they all at one instant time alike, made their
reuerent curtesies in bowing of their knees, and in like manner when
they did rise from of their seates, euerie one apparrelled in cloth of
Golde, but they did not sit and eate at the same table.

Streight before the triumphant Queene was the opening of the third
Curtaine, couering a great and goodly doore, not of Marble, but of rare
and hard Diasper of the East, of an artificiall and ancient worke,
wonderfully bewtifull to behold. Vpon either sides of this doore, their
yoong damosels Musitians, seuen vpon a side in a Nimpish apparrel,
notable for the fashion and verie rich: which at euery change of
seruice, did alter their Musicke and Instruments, and during the
banquetting, others with an Angelike and Syreneall consent, did tune the
same to their handes. Then in a sodaine was placed frames of Hebony,
with three feete, and other temporary tables, without any noyse or
brustling. Euerie one readie to his appoynted Office, with a carefull,
diligent, and affecting indeuour, wholy to that seruice which was
enioyned him.

And first before the Queene, there was placed a frame of three feete of
this fourme, vpon a rounde of fine Dyasper, with curious Lineaments. To
the which were three stypits, the lower partes whereof, did finish in
the forme of the tearing claw of a Lyon, with an exsquisite foliature,
compassing about the steales of the stypets, hauing in the middest of
euerie one, fastened the head of a childe betwixt two wings, from the
which betwixt one and other of the stypets, there hung in maner of a
Garland a bundle of leaues and fruites bounde togither, and biggest
towardes the midst, and vppon the top of the stypets or steales, was put
a proiection to beare vp the rounde table before the Queene.

This frame was vnmoueable, but the round table was to be quickly taken
of and on, according to the substance of the vessels at euery changing
of the table.

And streight way as it were in the twinckling of an eye and turne of a
hand, there was put vppon this three footed frame a rounde table of
Golde, three foote by the Diameter, and of an indifferent thicknesse,
and of this forme and bignes were all the rest.

Vpon this table was laide a Carpet perfumed, of cloth of Hormisine of a
greene colour, euenly distended large and long downe to the pauement:
fringed vpon the sides with twisted threede of the selfe same, and mixed
with Siluer and Golde, depending downe vnder a border of imbroyderie of
Pearle and pretious stone, with a hand-breadth of the pauement on euerie
side hanging downe. And of this sort were all the Carpets bordered and
fringed.

Afterwards followed a faire yoong Damosell and quicke, with a great
Bason of Gold filled with the flowers of Violets, tawny, blew & white,
and sweet smelling, as in the prime spring time, and strewing of them
vpon the tables, except that before the Queene.

Her sacred maiestie, hauing put off her robe so gorgeous as _Lolia_,
wife to _Paulus Aemilius_ neuer saw in her husbandes tryumphes, and shee
remayned in a gowne of purple Veluet, hauing wouen in it birdes, little
beastes, leaues and flowers in knottes, the worke somewhat raysed vp
with pearle and stone, with a thynne vayle couering it all ouer of silke
syprusse, shewing through it the couered workes and cloath by reason of
the cleare subtiltie and thinnesse thereof, and imperiall and gratious
apparell.

After came in two beautifull Damosels bringing in an artificious
fountaine continually running with water, and reassuming the same
agayne, which was of fine golde, and in a vessell of a curious
workmanshippe, which was brought before the Queene, and after the
presenting of it vpon the table of golde they bowed their knees downe to
the pauement, and like reuerence at the same instaunt made all the rest
of the attendant Ladyes, both at the presenting of euery thing, and at
the taking away. Three other faire Damosels followed neare after them,
one carrying an Ewer of golde, the second a bason, and the other a
towell of white silke.

  [Illustration]

The Queen whilest shee did wash her handes, one that caried the golden
bason, receyued therin the water, that it might not fall agayne into the
reassuming fountaine: and the other with the Ewrie, powred in as much
sweete water as was borne away, because that the fountaine shoulde not
be emptie, and hyndered in hys course. The third did wipe and drie her
hands.

The broad and large Receptorie of this fountaine was carryed vpon foure
little wheeles, which they drew vppon euerie table to wash the handes of
all that were sette.

The brim of the vessell wherein the rising vp fountaine did stande, was
adorned with bubbles of pearle standing vp, and vnder the same was sette
an other of an other sorte, and both ioyned together with two claspes of
an exquisite dipoliture, fine worke, and pretiously garnished. For among
other iewelles of inestimable price, vppon the verie toppe in a flower,
there was sette a Diamond in fashion of a peare, glistering and
sparkling of a huge and vnseene bignes.

And as neare as my smell could tell mee, I did iudge the water to bee of
Roses, mixt with the iuice of Lymon pilles, and a little Amber
artificially composed, which yeelded a sweet and pleasant smell.

  [Illustration]

In the middest of this admirable and stupendious Court, there was set
out a maruellous perfuming vessel, not so much for the excellent and
perfecte substaunce thereof, which was pure and fine golde: but for the
conspicuous, rare, and auncient fashion of the base, standing vpon three
Harpyes feete, the which in a foliature made a trianguled illygament to
the base, full of deuises, as the mettall required, ouer euerie Angle or
corner whereof stoode three naked shapes of flying spirites orderly
sette, of two cubites high, with their shoulders turned one towards an
other, and somewhat neare together.

They stood vpon the base with the right foot towards the corner, and the
lefte stretching towardes the fixed foot of the other boye. Their cubits
bending vp, and holding the handle of the perfuming panne, verie slender
in the steale, and vpward in fashion of a bowle, somewhat furrowed and
broad lipped.

There were six in a round circuit, one towardes an other: And betwixt
theyr shoulders in the Center point of the trianguled base, there rose
vp a steale like an olde fashioned Candlesticke, holding on the toppe
thereof suche a bowle or vessell as aforesaide, and so broade as did
fill vp the voyde place in the middest betwixt the other six.

Which bowles were filled with burning coles couered ouer with embers,
and in euery vessell vppon the ashes did boyle a little pot of gold,
which contrary liquors infused with sweet odours.

And as I suspected, euery potte had seuerall water, as it were, one with
Rose-water, another with water of Orange flowers, another of myrtle,
tender greene Lawrell leaues, elder flowers, and diuers such lyke
sociable symples. And these boyling together, they did yeelde a most
pleasant and fragrant smell.

In the presence of the magnificent Queene there did alwayes wayte and
attend three honourable Nymphes, their apparell beeing of golde and
silke, maruelously wouen and adorned, and sette with pearle and stone.
The lyninges of theyr gownes going about their snowie shoulders, and
comming downe vppon theyr little round brestes to the lower parte of
their wastes, of suche colour as the napkins, leauing to be seene the
pleasaunt valleys betwixt their faire brestes, an extreame delight and
desired nourishment vnto a narrowe looke and greedie eye, with a
thousand small chaynes, pretie iewelles and flowers of golde in a
fæminine sort, a sweet bayte to carrie a man headlong into forgetfulnes
of hymselfe, beeing inchaunted with choyse and amorous regards, farre
passing the desire of any other delycate vyands. Their shooes of golde
cutte with halfe Moones, and closed vp at the ioyning of the hornes or
corners with buttons and flowers of gold-smithes woorke in a curious
sorte, and the trammels of their faire and plentifull haire aboue their
forheads and temples instrophiated with large and round oryent pearle.

They stoode thus on eyther hande and before the Queene with a singular
and reuerent regarde, attending and readilie perfourming that charge
whereunto they were appoynted. And these serued but an one Table: which
beeing chaunged, they withdrewe themselues by, and stoode still vppon
theyr feete arme in arme, other three hauing supplyed their places: And
the three that wayted, shee in the middest was caruer.

The other vppon the right side helde vnder a plate if anie thing should
fall by: and the thirde vppon the lefte hand held a most whyte and
cleane towell of silke to drie her lippes, and in euery action a
reuerence.

The towell was not vsed but once, and then cast by vpon the pauement,
and carryed away by one that stoode neare. And so many morsels as shee
did eate, so many sweete perfumed cleane towelles of silke plyted and
finely wrought were vsed.

And the like was doone to euerie guest, for not one at that banquet did
touch anie thinge sauing onelye the cuppe.

After that the Queene had washed, and had her first seruice, then all
the rest did wash at the same fountaine, casting out water of it selfe,
and reassuming the same in a wonderfull manner by two small pypes on
eyther sides, and running vp straight in the middest from the bottome of
the vessell, the deuyse whereof when I did vnderstand, I was much
contented therewithall.

After the washing of the Queene first, and successiuely of all the rest,
there was deliuered to euery one of the wayters a rounde ball of golde
wyer-woorke full of small holes, and within stuft with Amber past of a
most perfect composition, set with pretious stones, to the ende their
hands, eyes, and sences should not be idle.

Then there at euerie chaunge of course, two _Edeabriees_ that had the
ordayning of the Queenes meate, did bring into the middest of the royall
Court vppon foure turning wheeles a stately repositorie or cupbord, in
fashion like vnto a shippe, and the rest like to a triumphant Chariot,
of most fine golde, with many fishes and water monsters, and infinit
other exquisite shapes maruelously wrought, and sette full of riche
stones, the sparklings and glisterings whereof did shine rounde about
the sides of the Court, and reincounter vpon the roundelles of the other
before spoken iewelles, on euery side fitly placed, as if Phœbus had
been sette by a Nymph to grace hir eyes and countenance with his shining
brightnes.

To all which continuall glistering of ineffable workemanshippe, there
could no more bee deuised of equall comparison, although it were the
Temple at Babylon with the three golden statues.

Within the which was put all such necessaries perfumed, as were meete
and conuenient for the chaunging of the tables, as clothes, flowers,
cuppes, towelles, and vesselles, to powre out of, to drinke in, and
plates to eate vpon.

And these two Nymphes plaustraries[A], did take them downe, and deliuer
them (as neede required) to the wayters.

    [Sidenote A: Which did draw in the cupbord.]

And the first Table beeing chaunged, euerie thing was brought backe
agayne to the plaustraries, at whose going away the Trumpettes sounded
in such a sorte, as _Piseus Therrenus_ neuer came neare vnto, nor
_Maletus_ Trumpetor to the King of Hetruria.

And then they did wind their Cornettes, thus dooing euerie time that the
repositorie was drawne out, vntil that it came in againe, at what time
they ceased.

And when the Table was chaunged, they altered their musicall
instruments, which beeing ceased, the singers began so heauenly, that it
would haue caused the Syrens to sleepe, hauing mixed with their voyces
still winde instruments of wood, such as the _Troezein Dardanus_ neuer
inuented.

And by this appoynted order, there was continually heard melodious
soundes, and pleasaunt harmonies, sweete concords with delightfull
Musicke presented, odoriferous perfume smelt, and stately viandes
plentifully fedde of. And euerie thing whatsoeuer, without any defect of
grace or delight answerable, according to the dignitie of the place.

To this first princely table, all the vessels and instruments togither
with the table it selfe, were of pure fine Gold. Wherupon there was
appresented a Cordiall confection, and as I could coniecture, it was
made of the scraping of Vnicornes horne, Date stones and Pearle, often
hette, and quenched and pownded small, Manna, Pineapple kernels, Rose
water, Musk and Lyquid, Golde, in a precious composition by weight, and
made Losenges with fine Sugar and Amylum.

This was eaten without any drinking vpon it, and it was a Confection to
prohibite all Feuers, and to driue away Melancholy wearines.

This being done in a moment, all things were taken vp and remoued, the
Violets cast vpon the ground, and the table bare. And assoone as this
was done, the table was laide againe couered with cloth of Talasike, and
also the wayters, and as at the first, there was cast vpon them the
sweete flowers of Cedars, Orenges, and _L_ymons, and vpon that, they did
appresent in vessels of Beryl, and of that precious stone was the
Queenes table (except the skinking pottes which were all of pure fine
Gold) fiue Fritters of paste of a Saffron colour, and crusted ouer with
extreeme hotte Rose water, and fine pownded Sugar, and then againe cast
ouer with musked water, and with fine Sugar like frost vpon Ise. These
Seruices of a most pleasant taste, and of sundry fashions were laid in
thus. The first, in oyle of the flowers of Orenges. The second, in oyle
of Gilliflowers. The third, in oyle of the floures of Gessamin. The
fourth, in pure Oyle of Beniamin.

And the last, in the oyle of Muske and Amber. And when we had wel tasted
and eaten of the same delectable meat, there was deliuered to vs a
goodly cup of the aforenamed Beryl, with his couer, and couered ouer
that also with a thinne Veyle of silke and Gold curiously folded into
the fourme of a Canapie, the ends cast ouer the shoulders of the
bearers, and hanging down their backe.

And in this sort they did present all drinking vessels and others, with
meates and sawces couered. Within the drinkyng cup they had infused a
precious Wine, so as mee thought that the Gods of the _Elysian_ fieldes,
had transformed their power into the sweetnes of the lyquor: surpassing
the wine of _Thassus_.

Without delaie (after our drinking this table being taken away, and the
sweete flowers cast vpon the pauement), there was forthwith spred a
cloth of murry silke and carnation: with Roses white, redde, Damaske,
Muske, and yealow cast vppon the same. And presently new wayters brought
in (apparrelled in the same colours) sixe pieces of bread cut for euery
one, tossed and dressed with refined marrow, sprinckled ouer with Rose
water, Saffron, and the iuice of Orenges, tempering the taste and gilded
ouer, and with them sixe pieces of pure manchet were set downe. And next
vnto them a confection, of the iuice of Lymons tempered with fine Sugar,
the seedes of Pines, Rose water, Muske, Saffron, and choyce Synamon, and
thus were all the sawces made with conuenient gradation and deliuery.
The vessels were of Topas and the round table.

This third magnificent table being taken vp as before said, there was
presently an other innouated, with a cloth of silke smooth, and of a
yealow colour, (the wayters sutable) and strewed with Lilly Conually,
and Daffadil, immediately this course was presented, seuen morsels of
the flesh of a Partridge in a sharpe broth, and so many pieces of pure
white Manchet. The sauce Acceres, minced and dissolued in Sugar thrice
sodden, Amylum, Saunders, Muske and Rose water. The vessels and the
rounde table of _Chrysolite_. Lastly, they offered a precious drinking
cup, and so obserued in the rest.

The fourth table beeing taken away, the fift was reuested with a cloth
of silke, of a crimosen colour, and in like sort the Nimphish apparrel.
The flowers of purple, yealow, white, and tawny. The Seruis, eight
morsels of the flesh of a Pheasant rosted lying in the grauie, and
withall so many pieces of fine white manchet. The sauce was this, water
of Orenge flowers, the iuice of Pomegranets, Sugar, Cloues, and Cynamon.
The vesselles of Smaragde, and the table of the Souereigne Queene.

This beeing taken away verie solemnely, there was spred an other cloth
of silke of a purple colour, and so the apparrel of the wayters.

The flowers were of three sortes, of Iessamine, tawny, yealow, and
white. The Seruice was nine morsels of the flesh of a restoratiue
Peacocke, moystened in his grauie. The sauce was most greene and tart,
with Pistacke, Nuttes pownded, Sugar, Cypricum, Amylum, and Muske, Time,
white Marioram, and Pepper. The vesselles of Saphyre, and the Princely
Table.

At the seuenth chaunge, they brought in a sumpteous table of white
Iuory, bordered, trayled, and finely wrought with many small pieces vpon
the precious wood of Aloes, and ioyned & glued togither, and from one
side to the other, wrought with knottes and foliature, flowers,
vesselles, monsters, little Birdes, and the strikes and caruings filled
vp with a black paste and mixture of Amber and Muske. This mee thought
was a most excellent thing and sumpteous breathing out, a most
delightful sweet smel. The cloth white and subtily wrought with drawne
worke with Satten silke, the ground powdered and filled, and the worke
white and plaine, with the representation of shapes, byrdes, beastes,
and flowers, and in like sort the apparel of the wayters. The flowers
Lady steale, Rape, Violet, and all sortes of sweete Gilliflowers. And
thus there varied euerie where such diuersitie of smelles, seuerally
brought in, and so delightfull to the sences, as I cannot sufficiently
expresse.

Then there was giuen to euerie one a confection in three morsels of the
shell, fish, Dactilus, with Pistacke, Nut kernels pownded and put into
Rose water and Sugar, of the Ilandes, and Muske and leafe Golde, beaten
and adulterated therwith, that euerie piece taken vp, seemed as if it
had beene all Gold.

The vessels were of Iacynth, and the table circular. An apt and
conuenient stone to so excellent disposition and royall board and
straunge banquets, suche as before were neuer heard of.

After the taking away of these wonderfull Confections, and the flowers
cast downe vpon the pauement in a princely magnificence, there was
presently brought in, a great vessell of Gold full of kindled coales,
into the which the table cloathes, napkins and towelles of silke were
throwne, whiche presently burned light, and after that beeing taken out
and cooled, they were whole, vnhurt and cleane, as at the first. And
this yet was the wonderfull straungest of all the rest. And then the
tables and frames were taken downe and carried away.

Which most excellent order and sightes, the more that I carefully
indeuoured to consider of them, the more ignorant and amazed I founde my
selfe.

But in all thinges assuredly I did take great pleasure with my intended
admiration, in seeing of such, so great, plentifull, and tryumphant
sumpteousnes, of so incredible costly a banket, that it is better to
holde my peace then not to speake sufficiently in the report thereof.
For that the bankets of _Sicilia_ be in respect but beggerly, and so
were the stately Ornaments of _Attalus_. The Corinthian vessels, the
dainties of _Ciprus_, and _Saliarie_ suppers.

Yet notwithstanding so supreame and excessiue alacritie, and cordiall
delectation, and that onely and extreeme pleasure (occasioned by such
and so vnexpected delightes) by one of those three which in the last
chaunge attended, was quayled, ouerthrowne, interrupted, lamed,
intercepted and made vaine. For shee did represent in her behauiour, the
sweet iesture and resemblance of _Polia_, stirring vp by them in me
stealing regardes.

This was no small hinderance vnto mee, in the takyng of those pleasant
dainties and princely refection. Yet notwithstanding my eyes would now
and then with much adoo, bee withdrawne to beholde the bewtie of the
Iewels and precious stones, sparkeling and glistering in euerie place,
in such diuersities of straunge and vnseene gloriousnes and conspicuous
decoraments, as if they had all ought a duetie to her, which made mee
with an immoderate desire, to behold the correspondency of her excellent
bewtie.

Lastly, in suche order and sorte, as aforesaide, the tables beeing taken
away, I hung downe my heade, because that I might not followe after the
last iunckates which I had lost by minding of her that ministred.

Then first before the sacred Maiestie and royall person of the Queene,
and afterwards to vs, fiue fayre Nymphes apparelled in blewe silke and
golde curiously wouen togeather in workes, did all together appresent
themselues.

The middlemost of them did beare a braunch of coorrall, lyke a tree,
such as is not founde amongst the Ilandes Orchades, of one cubite high,
which stoode as vppon a little mountayne, which was the couer of an old
fashioned vessell of pure gold, in forme of a Challyce, as high agayne
as the couer and the tree of coorrall, full of curious workmanshippe and
leafe worke, neuer made in our age, nor the like seene.

Betwixt the gracylament of the foote and the cuppe, it was knitte
together with a handle of inestimable workemanship, and in lyke manner
the foote and the bowle were of an excellent anaglyphie of foliature,
monsters and byformed Scyllules, so exquisitely expressed, as could be
imbossed, chased, or ingrauen by proportionate circulation.

And the mordycant couer of the same was thicke set with incomparable
iewelles: and in lyke sorte all the base and handle whereas conueniencie
requyred, and glystering about.

Vppon the braunches of the coorrall, there were artificially sette
certayne open flowers with fiue leaues, some of Saphyre, some of Iacynth
and Berill, and in the middest of them a little round seede of golde,
fastening the leaues to the stalke of corrall.

Which yoong woman reuerently bowing to the earth with her right knee,
reseruing the other still vp, whereuppon shee helde this couer of
coorrall, which also besides the flowers, had vppon the pointes and
toppes of other twigges or sprouts curiously infixed monstrous great
pearle. An other of them had a cuppe full of pretious lyquor, better
then that which the prowde _Cleopatra_ gaue vnto the Romane Captaine:
The reste did execute their offices as aforesaid, and plucking off one
after another, with a little instrument with two teeth of golde they
offering the same fruits vnto vs, to me vnknowne, for that I had neuer
seene the lyke, we did tast them.

But the vnexpected pleasure of them, and sweetnes of their tast, was no
otherwise to me than like a gratious substance wanting his desired
forme.

And there were restored agayne the balles of golde before mentioned.

Vppon this appeared an other maruellous woorke, that was a perpetuall
running fountaine artificially deuysed of the aforesaid matter, but of
an other notable fashion and workemanshippe, founded vppon an immoueable
axeltree, vppon the which two wheeles turned about.

Aboue the which stood an vnequal quadrature three foot long, two foot
broad, and six foote high.

In euery angular part did sit a Harpie with both her winges extended and
stretched vp to the breadth of a higher vessell, standing vp vppon the
middest of the measured quadrangule, coronized at the extreme and vpper
parts, and beautified with chanelling and foliature, circumuesting the
lower part.

And vppon euerie side the same diuided into three, the middle parte
betwixt the fall of the waters intercepted, did contayne in halfe bodyes
carued, a tryumph of Satyres and Nymphes, with Trophees, and exquysite
actions, excepte the fore-part and hinder parte moderately sinuated and
bent in. The which in steade of squadred lyneament, did contayne a
roundnesse waued betweene, in the which was maruellously ingrauen a
little sacrifice with an olde Aultar on eyther sides, with manie figures
and actions, the rest that was voyde, the tayles of the foresayde
Harpyes ioyning togeather, and turning heere and there into leaues, did
excellently couer the same.

Out of the medyan center of the equature and quadrangule afore specified
and described out of an antyke folyature, did ryse vp an olde fashioned
vessell, and verie beautifull, the cyrcuite whereof did not exceede the
content of the quadrangulate playne, and this with all the rest of the
woorke, and euerie proportionate disquisition, tryall, and examination,
both in the highest breadth and thicknesse, with moste conuenient
vesseling lineamentes, diligently delymated and fyled, and then finished
with an absolute and depolyte deformation.

The which out of the suppressed orifice thereof did ascend vp an other
hollowe vessell, the compasse whereof did exceede the aforesaide subiect
vessell furrowed and channelled round about, of a great breadth and
large brymmes so wel fashioned, as is possible for any goldsmith to
beate out with his hammer.

In the center poynt whereof did rise and mount an other vessell of
incredible workemanship.

In the bottome of which thirde there were small ridges swelling
outwardes, the toppes of them compassed about with a row of diuerse
inestimable stones, bearing out and differing in colours, as best might
content the eye of a curious Lapidarie and skilfull vnderstanding.

Vppon the same on eyther sides was made a heade of a monster, from the
which on both handes did proceede the garnishing thereof in an exquysite
and most rare worke of leaues, inuesting the same about with the
congresse of the opposyte heade, and finely gracing that parte of the
vessell.

And in the bearing out of the lippe of the vessell ouer the
perpendicular poynt of the heade there was fastened a rynge, from the
which vppon eyther sides there hung downe a garland of braunches,
leaues, flowers, and fruites growing bigger towardes the middest, with a
perpolyte bynding to eyther ringes.

Ouer the middle bending of the garland, and vnder the proiecture of the
lyppe of the vessell, there was fixed and placed the head of an olde
man, with his beard and haire of his head transformed into nettle
leaues, and out of whose mouth gushed out the water of the fountayne by
art continually into the hollownes of the broad vessell vnder this.

Vppon the mouth of this last described vessell did mount vppe a pretyous
hyll maruellously congest, and framed of innumerable rounde pretious
rocke stones closing one with another vnequally, as if nature had ioyned
them growing, making a rounde composed hill, beautifully glistering of
dyuerse sortes and colours in a proportionate bignes.

And aloft vppon the toppe of this little hill, there grewe a fine
pomgranate tree, the body, boughes and fruite made all of golde, the
leaues of greene Smaragde. The fruit of theyr naturall bignesse heere
and there aptly placed, their sides cut open, and in place of kernelles
they were full of most perfecte Rubyes, as bigge as the kernels.

After that, the ingenious Artificer wanting no inuention, hee seperated
the graynes in steade of the fylme with siluer foyle.

And moreouer, in other apples, opened, but not rype, hee redoubled the
thicknesse of the foyle, making the kernelles of an oryentall colour, so
also hee made the flowers of perfect corrall, in the cuppes full of bees
of golde.

Besides this, out of the toppe of the hollowe steale, lyke a pype, there
came out a turning steale, the lowest part whereof rested in a heade,
framed from the middle trunke or pype iust ouer the axeltree.

Which steale or stypet beeing strongly fastened, it bare vp a vessell of
Topas of an auncient forme, the bowle whereof in the bottome was broad,
and swelling out with rigges in the opening, rarely bewtified with a
coronice, and put vnder with another.

In which closing and binding together in foure equall diuisions, there
were foure winged heades of a little childe, with foure pipes in their
mouthes.

The rest mounted vp so much as the lower bignesse of the vessell was,
beeing closed vp at the orifice with an inuerse foliature. Vppon the
which there was placed an other vessell as it were a circular couer of a
most curious leafe worke, with a smal coronice, and an artificiall
orifice.

From the bottome of which there beganne a flourished tayle of a Dolphin
fastened and sowldered to the gracylament of the vessell, descending
downe with his heade finned with leaues, to the circulating brymme of
the vessell where the boyes heades were fixed. And with a moderate
swelling out about the head, and streightning in towardes the tayle,
they fitted for the eares in a beautiful manner. And all that inclining
part with an exquisite polishing did make an expresse shewe of most
curious lineaments.

The vpper vessell was so perfectly wrought, that when the wheele was
mooued, the steale with the vessell vppon the toppe thereof, turned
about and powred out water through the tree, and when the wheele stoode
still, then that lefte turning.

  The wheeles were halfe couered with two winges, the
      typpes turning one one way, and the other an
          other way, adorned with a chasing
              of Mermaydes or Scillaes.

  [Illustration]

This excellent peece of woorke thus running before euerie one, and
weeting our handes and feete of an incredible sweetnesse, such as I
neuer had felt before, we dryed our hands, and it was carryed away.

And beeing thus sprinckled with this rare and maiesticall water, the
wayters with great reuerence presented vnto the Queene first a great
cuppe of golde, and her highnesse affably saluting vs, drunke Nectar,
and afterwardes euerie one of vs after other, with reuerent, mutual, and
solemne honours done, did drinke a most pleasaunt farewell and shutting
vp of all the pretious dainties that we had tasted and fed vpon.

Lastly, the redolent flowers beeing diligently taken away, and all
thinges that had beene vsed borne from thence, the pauement remayned
pure and shining as a most cleare steele glasse, and as it were
emulating the pretious iewelles rownde about.

  And euerie one beeing sette in his appoynted place, the
  high and mightie Princesse did commaund a company to come
    in, and stande vppon the diasper checkers, neuer the
            like before seene or imagined of anie
                      mortall creature.




_Poliphilus followeth to shew besides this great banket of a most
  excellent daunce or game, and how the Queene did commit him to two of
  her Nymphes, the which did leade and conduct him to the sight of many
  wonderfull things, and as they talked, shewed vnto him the secrecies
  of such things as hee stood in doubt of. Finally, how they came to
  the three gates, in the middlemost whereof, hee remained amongst the
  amorous Nymphes._


Hauing spoken something of the exceeding & incomparable glorie, triumph,
vnknowne treasure, plentiful delights, solemne banket, and the most
honourable and sumptuous drinking of this most happie and rich Queene,
if I haue not distinctly and perfectly expressed her chiefest dignitie,
let not the curious company maruel thereat, for whatsoeuer rype, sharpe,
and readie wit, with a franke, eloquent and plentiful toong adorned,
is not able to performe the least part of his duetie.

And much lesse I, who continually suffer in euerie secret place of my
burning heart, an vncessant strife notwithstanding the absence of
_Polia_ my mistres, the owner of all my skil, and imprisoner of my
perfections.

Besides that, in truth the many maruels in excellency, and varietie
vnhard of, so vncoth, rare and straunge vnlikes inestimable, and not
humane, haue so oppressed, laden & born down my sences, with the greedie
and excessiue contemplation and beholding of their variable diuersities,
as that from point to point I am no whit able to describe them, and much
lesse worthie to publish them.

All and the most that I can do, is to thinke of the rich apparrel,
exquisite prouision, curious dressings, perfect ambitious and wounding
bewties without imperfections, their deepe iudgements, _Aemilian_
eloquence, & bountie more then princely, the notable disposition and
order of Architecture, the durable Symmetrie and proportion of the
building, perfect and absolute, the noblenes of the Art of Masonrie and
Lapycidarie, the directions and placing of Columnes, the perfection of
statues and representations, the adornment of the walles, the diuersitie
of the stones, the stately entrance & princely porch, large Gallery,
artificious pauements, no man will thinke with what cost and charge
bewtified and hanged with precious Arras and Verdure. The spacious and
loftie inner Court, goodly bedchambers, inner withdrawing chambers,
parlours, bathes, librarie and pinacloth, where coat Armors escuchions,
painted tables, and counterfeates of strangers were kept, & with a
maiestical comelines and order placed and solemnely distributed.

In which conceiuing capacitie, maruellous performance, incredible charge
and high commendation of the most excellent Artificer, woorthily allowed
in euerie partition and elegant conuention of exquisite Lineaments. I
also beheld a marueilous twisted conlignation or couering of gold-smiths
work, ouer a foure square plaine Court, growing vp alike, without
comparison like a heauen, with a disposite distance of many sorted
proportions, with sundry lybellated Dimensions, shadowing ouer the
Court, with an Arched Eminence, which was vnder, adorned with coronised
Lyneaments and grauings, thereunto conuenient, as Fasheols, Gululles,
and Oualling, and the leaues of _Achanthus_, licking vp as it were in
the corners of the quadranguled Court. With Roses and the growing order
of their leaues, the top leafe least, their iaggings about the leaues,
and space betweene leafe and leafe. All thinges couered with pure fine
gold and Azure colour, with diuers other proportions and counterfets of
substance, equal with their workemanship. The roofing of _Salances_ King
of _Colchis_, may not compare with this.

Then the delightful fruitfulnes of the set hedges, Orchards, watered
Gardens, springing Fountaines, current streames in Marble Channelles,
conteined, framed, and held in, with an incredible Art, greene Hearbes,
still freshe and flowering, a sweete ayre, warme and spring windes, with
a confused charme of singing and chirping birdes, a pure, faire and
bright aire, and stil continuing temperate and healthfull, country free
from danger and cleane, No craggy nor rockie places, nipt and blasted
with sharpe windes, nor burnt with an vntemperate hotte Sunne, but vnder
a sweet and pleasant temperature, in a moderate meane reioycing, betwixt
two extreemes, the fields fruitful and without tillage and manuring,
yeelding all commodities, warme hilles, greene woods and sweet coole
shadowes.

Also the inestimable furniture, the attendant housholde and great
number, their excellent seruice, the diuersitie of youthes, and all in
the prime of their yeares. The delightfull presence of the Nymphes, both
attending abroad in the presence and chambers, her baser sort, their
honourable and gracious behauiours, their diuersitie of apparrel, attire
and dressings set with Pearle and stone, in an allowed, pleasant &
louely sort, as any can imagine or expresse. With these infinite riches,
supreame delightes, and immeasurable treasure, neither _Darius_,
_Cræsus_, or any other humane state, whatsoeuer might any way compare.

And thus to conclude, being ouercome with the glorie of them, I know not
what more to say, but that I stood amazed, and as it were senceles, and
yet in great delight and without wearines, beholding those present
obiects, and casting with my selfe what fate and destinate should
conduct and leade mee into such a place.

But afterwardes finding my selfe in such an accumulation of glorie,
pleasant seate, happie Country, great contentment and tryumphant
company, such as _Clodius_ the Player in Tragedies neuer had seene. I
was but moderately conuerted, notwithstanding the promise of the Queene,
to fauour my amorous desire, accounting all, but as eye pleasures that
hitherto I had seene and had been presented vnto me, stil desiring a
greater happines.

For which cause, and for the greater setting out of the excesse and
abounding excellency, beyond all the rest of her royall magnificence,
euery one sitting in their place after the miraculous, wonderful, and
sumpteous banket, without any delaie, she commanded a game to be playd
by parsonages, not onelie woorthie the beholding, but of eternall
remembrance, which was a game at Chesse, in this sort as followeth.

By the entraunce of the curtaine there came in thirty two Nymphes,
whereof sixteene were apparrelled in cloth of gold (eyght vniformally
without difference of degrees) afterwards one of those sixteene was
apparrelled in princely robes lyke a King, and the other lyke a Queene,
with two tower-keepers or Rookes, as wee tearme them, two
counsell-keepers or Secretaries, wee tearme them Bishoppes, and two
Knights. In like sort were eight other in cloth of siluer, vnder the
like gouernement and magistracie as aforesaid.

Euerie one of these according to their duties, tooke theyr places vppon
the checkers of the pauement, that is, sixteene in golde of one side in
two rowes, and sixteene in siluer of the contrarie side.

The Musicke beganne vppon a sodayne with a rare inuention to sound a
charge with a pleasaunt concord, participating togeather a sweete and
thundering melodie, hauing in it a deuine furie.

At the measured sounde and time of the Musicke vppon their checkers,
as it pleased the King to commaund, the pawns turning themselues with a
decent reuolution, honouring the King and the Queene, leapt vppon an
other checker before them.

The King of the white men, his musicke sounding, commaunded her forward
that stoode before the Queene, and the same with lyke reuerent behauiour
marched forward her continent, and stoode still. And according to the
mensuration of the musicall time in this order, so they chaunged their
places, or continued vppon the checkers dauncing, vntill that they were
eyther taken or commaunded forward by the King.

If the musicke kepte still one time, those eyght vnyforme pawnes did
spende the time in marching forwardes into an other checker, neuer
comming backe vntill that worthily without touch or appalement of
courage, they had leapt vppon the line of that square where was the
residence of the Queene, proceeding straight on, vnlesse she tooke a
prisoner by a Diagonick line.

The Bishop went in a Diagonike line, still holding that coloured checker
wherein he stood first.

The Knight ouer two checkers before him taketh the next of eyther
handes, and of a contrary colour to that hee stood in immediately
before.

The Castle-keepers or Rookes might passe ouer manie checkers streight on
as they pleased at commaundement, so that they might goe one, two,
three, foure, or fiue checkers, keeping a measure, and not staying in
their march.

The King might goe vpon anie checker if none were in it, or backeward,
and cause any other to remooue for him, and make him roome.

The Queene might goe any way, but it is best when shee is neare her
husband on euery side.

And whensoeuer the officers of eyther of the Kings shall finde one
without guarde of helpe, they take her prisoner, and both kissing one
another, she that is ouercome and taken, goeth foorth and standeth by.

Thus they continued playing and dauncing according to the time of the
musicke, with greate pleasure, solace, and applause, vntill the King of
the siluer Nymphes was victour and conquerour.

This solemne sport, what with resistance flying backe, and seconding of
one an other, with such a measured circulation, reuerence, pause, and
modest continencie, endured the space of an hower, whereat I tooke such
pleasure and delyght, that I imagyne (and not amysse) that I was rapt
vpon the sodaine from the liking of the sportes of Olympus to a newe
felicitie.

This first game beeing ended, and conquest obtayned, all retourned into
theyr accustomed places, and in like manner as at the first, so the
second time euerie one in theyr appoynted checkers, the Musicke
chaunging theyr measure, so the moouings and gestures of the players
were altered.

And obseruing the time of the musicke in a conuenient order, and
approoued gesture and arte, that it was no neede to commaund or say any
thing.

But the cunning and experte Nymphes, with theyr plentifull tresses
effused ouer theyr delicate shoulders hung wauing, and in theyr motion
forwardes would streame out at length, somewhat shewing their backes,
about their heades wearing Garlandes and Crownes of Violets. And when
any one was taken, they lifted vp their armes and clapt handes. Thus
playing and coursing vp and downe, the first continued still conquerour.

In the last game and daunsing, they beeing all returned to their
distributed places, the Musicke againe sounded a measure phrygiall in as
perfect and prouoking furie as euer _Marcias_ of _Phrygia_ inuented.

The King in robes of Golde, caused the yoong Damosell that stood before
the Queene, to marche forwarde to the third Checker, direct in the first
remooue, whereupon immediately there was seene a battaile and Torney,
with so swift and sodaine forces, bending themselues to the grounde as
it were lying close vpon their Garde, and presently vpon it capering vp
with a turne twise aboue ground, one iust opposite against an other, and
vpon their downe come withall a turne vpon the toe thrise about.

All this Action they did at one time, with such a grace and agilitie, as
nothing could be better, with their lowe inclinatitions, high Capers and
Turnings, without affectation of strayning, as it should seeme with
facilitie and careles ease at pleasure and sweete iestures, as in such a
thing may bee imagined, and not else where to bee seene. Neuer any one
troubling an other, but who so was taken prisoner, did presently kisse
their Conquerour, and voyded the place. And the lesser number that there
was, the more pleasure it was to perceiue the pollicies of either sides
to ouercome other.

And such an order and motion was vsed of euerie one, in a commendable
sort without fault, as the measure and time of the Musike appointed,
stirryng euen them that looked on to haue a motion in their sinowes and
mindes to doo the lyke, there was such a concord and agreement betwixt
nature and the Musike especially, seeing the performance of the same in
the actions of others.

Vpon this occasion I was moued to call to remembrance the force of
_Timotheus_, the most cunning musitian, who with his voice and measure
vppon his Instrument would prouoke the great Macedonian _Alexander_,
violently to take Armes, and presently altering his voyce and tune, to
forget the same, and sit downe contentedly. In this third game, they
apparrelled in gold did triumph in the victoritie.

Thus honourably with exceeding pleasure and great solace, this sumpteous
feast beeing ended, euerie one framed themselues to sit downe. And I
rysing vp, made reuerence before the Royall seate of her sacred
maiestie, and kneelyng downe vpon my knee, she thus said vnto me.

_Poliphilus_, forget now, and wype out of thy remembrance all forepassed
griefes, occursiue troubles, pensiue conceites, and ouergone daungers,
because that I am assured of thy forthwith full contentment of desire.

And seeing that thy determination is to perseuere resolutely in the
amorous flames and loue of _Polia_, I thinke it conuenient, that for the
recouerie thereof, thou repaire to the three Portes, which are the
resident places of the high and mightie Queene _Telosia_, in which place
vppon euerie of those Portes and Gates, thou shalt see her tytle and
name inscrypt. Read it diligently, but for thy better direction and
safegarde, thou shalt haue to accompany thee, two of my handmaydes,
which know verie well the way thither, and therefore go on vndoubtedly
with a happie successe.

And thereupon with a princely bountie, she drew of from her finger a
Ring of gold, hauing set in it an Anchit, and deliuered it vnto me to
remember her bountie by.

At this aduise and precious gift, I became amphasiatike, not knowing
what to saie or doo, in requitall or giuing of thankes. Which her
Highnes perceiuing, motherly and with a naturall promptnes in a
maiestical grauitie, turned her countenance to two noble and goodly
Nymphes, attending neere vnto her Royall and imperiall Throne, saying
thus to one of them vpon her right side.

_Logistica_, you shall bee one that shall accompanye our guest
_Poliphilus_, and with a sacred and honourable grace, shee turned to the
left hande saying, _Thelemia_, you shall also go with him. And both of
you shewe and instruct him at what Gate hee must remayne, and then
_Poliphilus_, they shall bring you to an other mightie and maiesticall
Queene, who if shee shall bee bountifull vnto thee in entertainment thou
art happie, if contrarie, then discontented.

Notwithstandyng, none doth knowe her intent by her countenance, because
that sometime shee sheweth her selfe full of fauour, loue, and pleasant
dispositions. An other time shee is malignant, frowarde, disdainefull,
with vnstable incursyue passions. And shee it is that determineth such
euents as thou seekest after. And for her obscure condition, shee is
rightly called _Thelosia_.

Her residence is not in suche a stately Pallaice, as thou seest mee to
dwell in.

Therefore I would haue thee to vnderstande, that the chiefe woorkeman in
the creation of nature, did make no thyng comparable to mee, neyther can
the earth shew thee greater treasure then to come to my presence and
taste of my bountie, obtaine my fauour and participate of my qualitie.

And therefore esteeme of it according to the value, for that thou
findest in me, is a heauenly Tallent aboue all earthly Iewels, for I
haue not had my residence in man since his fall.

They may imagine of mee, but they knowe mee not, neyther doo I beare any
rule with them to the good of my selfe.

Nowe the Queene _Telosia_, shee dwelleth in a place of cloudie darkenes,
her house is kept close and shut, for that shee will not shew her selfe
vnto man, nor anothomise, discouer, and laye open her selfe vnto any as
shee is, and for this cause the euent of her variable determination is
kept secret.

But in a maruellous sort considerately, shee transformeth her selfe
against the haire, into diuers fashions, not manifesting her selfe,
although desired.

And when the auncient Gates shall be opened vnto thee, in euerie one
shall bee written what shall befall thee, but thou shalt not perceiue
the same, vnless that in some part thy vnderstandyng and wisedome
enigmatically and with a right and sincere iudgement looke vnto it, and
quickly consider of it, for because that shee ambyguously chaungeth her
selfe in habite and countenance, and through this doubtfull
anymaduersion, a man remaineth deceiued of his expectation without
remedie.

And therefore _Polphilus_, that which these my consigned trustie and
appoynted handmaydes by suggestion shall perswade thee vnto, and at what
Gate thou oughtest to enter in and remayne, euen which of those two it
shall best please thee to giue eare vnto, doo: for they haue some
vnderstanding of her.

And hauyng thus spoken, shee made a signe or becke with her head to the
two Nymphes _Logistica_ and _Thelemia_, who presently without delaie,
were obedient to her commaund. And I beeing readie to speake, neyther
knew what to say, or yet durst to so high a maiestie, and for so great
bounties giue a word.

The two appoynted companyons of my iourney, verie fauourablye, and with
a familiar readines and virginlike iestures, tooke holde of mee, one by
the right hande, and the other by the left, and reuerently obteyning
licence, first of the Queene, and takyng theyr leaue of the rest, went
out the same way that I came in.

And I beeyng desirous and not satisfied, turned mee about towardes the
conspicuous Poarch, to beholde diligently the artificious Pallaice,
wonderfull and perfinite of the Art of building.

The subtiltie of which, no humane excogitation is able to imitate.

And therefore I thought that nature had made that for a maruell of all
her woorkes for commoditie, vse, grace, bewtie, ayre, and continuall
durablenes.

For which cause, I was excessiuely desirous to staie and looke vppon it,
but my leaders and guides would not suffer mee, and yet by the theft of
my eye in the Zopher, ouer the gate I noted this inscription, Ο ΤΗΣ
ΦΥΣΕΩΣ ΟΛΒΟΣ.

And as muche as with my quicke sences I could carrie, I tooke in my
going foorth, with as greate pleasure and delight as is possible to
expresse. O happie were hee that myght bee but a drudge or kitchin slaue
in suche a Paradice.

Nowe beeing come into the base Court, compassed and sette about with
Orenge trees, _Thelemia_ in great curtesie saide thus vnto mee, besides
and aboue all the maruellous and woonderfull thinges which thou hast yet
seene and behelde, there bee fower yet remayning behynde whiche thou
shalt see.

And vppon the lefte side of the incomparable pallace, they brought mee
into a fayre Orchyard of excogitable expence, tyme, and subtletie of
woorke-manshippe, the contynent and cyrcuite whereof was as muche as the
plot of the Pallace, wherein was the resydence and abiding of the
Queene.

Round about fast by the walles of the Orchyard there were set conuenyent
garden pots in the which in stead of growing plantes, euerie one was of
pure glasse, exceeding a mans imagination or beleefe, intorpiaried[A]
boxe the rootes and stalkes of golde, whereout the other proceeded.

    [Sidenote A: Ars toparia is the way of cutting of trees in gardens
    or other places to proportions or shapes.]

Betwixt one and other of the which was placed a Cyprusse tree, not aboue
two paces high, and the boxe one pace full of manyfolde maruellous
symples, with a moste excellent imitation of nature, and pleasaunt
diuersitie in the fashions of flowers in distinct colours verie
delyghtfull.

The playne labiall compassing about the quadrant Orchyard comming out
from the walles as a seate for these aforesayde garden pottes and trees
to stande vppon, was subcoronized with golde by excellent lyneamentes
wrought and adorned. The vpper face whereof, and whereuppon those pottes
and trees did stande, was couered with a playster of glasse gilte, and a
curious historographie to be seene in the same, and compassed about and
holden in with wyering and netting of golde.

The wall that compassed about the Orchyard with a conuenient distance,
was bellyed out with columnes of the same matter, and inuested with
flowring bindings naturally proportioned, and heere and there were
quadrangulate columnes of golde chamfered, arching from one to an other,
with a requisite beame Zophor and coronice, with a meete and conuenient
proiecture ouer the chapter of glasse vppon the round.

The substance of which subiect proiecture of the bryttle matter, was of
counterfayte diasper diuersly coloured and shining. Which bryttle
substance had some void space betwixt that and the other.

The mouth of the arches were stopped with rombyes of cleare glasse in
forme of a tryangle, and the pypes beautified all ouer with an
Encaustick painting, verie gratious to the sight of the beholder.

The ground was here and there couered with great round balles of
glasselyke gunne stones, and other fine proportions much pleasing, with
a mutuall consent vnmooueable lyke pearles shining without any
adulteration by folyature. From the flowers did breath a sweet
fragrancie by some cleare washing with oyle for that purpose.

There most cunningly did _Logistica_ lyke an Orator make a discourse in
commendation physically of that excellent confection of the noblenes of
the substaunce, secrecie of the art, and straungenes of the inuention.
The like is not to bee found.

And after shee sayde, _Poliphilus_ lette vs goe and ascende vp this
mount nexte the Garden, and _Thelemia_ remayning at the stayre foote,
wee ascended vp to the playne toppe. Where shee shewed vnto mee, with a
heauenly eloquence, a Garden of a large compasse, made in the forme of
an intricate Laborynth allyes and wayes, not to bee troden, but sayled
about, for insteade of allyes to treade vppon, there were ryuers of
water.

The which mysticall place was of a verie lustie mould and fruitfull,
replenished with all sorts of fruits, beautified with faire springs, and
greene hearbes and flowers, full of all solace and delight. Whereupon
she spake thus.

I doe imagine (_Poliphilus_) that you doe not vnderstande the
conditionate state of this maruellous seate, and therefore giue
attendance to my wordes.

Whosoeuer entereth in cannot come backe, but as you see yonder
mountaines heere and there distributed, seuen circuits and the about
goings distant one from another.

And the extreeme molestation and sorrowe of the enterers in, is this:
In the myddle mountayne within the center thereof, and open mouth of the
same, there lurketh inuisibly a deadly deuouring olde Dragon, hee is
vtter destruction to some, and others are not hurte to death by him. Hee
cannot bee seene nor shunned, neyther doth hee leaue any vnassaulted,
but eyther in the entrie, or in their iourney, hee destroyeth or
woundeth. And if hee killeth them not betwixt one mountayne and another,
they passe the seuen circuites to the next mount.

And they that enter in by the first tower or mount (wherevppon is this
tytle inscript ΔΟΞΑ ΚΟΣΜΙΚΗΩΣ ΠΟΜΦΟΛΥΣ). They sayle in a little
shippe with a prosperous winde, and securely at pleasure: the fruites
and flowers fall downe vppon theyr hatches, and with great solace and
pleasure they cut through by the seauen reuolutions with a merry winde,
vntill the second mount bee discouered and come vnto. And marke and
beholde (_Poliphilus_) howe cleare and bright the ayre is in the
entrance, ouer that it is in the center, about the which is thicke
darknesse.

In the first mount or tower there is alwayes resident a pittifull matron
and bountifull, before whome standeth an auncient appoynted vessell
called _Vrna_, in a readinesse, hauing vppon it seauen Greeke letters as
thus ΘΕΣΠΙΟΝ, full of appoynted honie, and to euerie one that entereth
in, verie curteously and with a good will shee giueth one of them
without respecte of state and condition, but according to theyr
enterance.

These beeing receyued, they came foorth, and begin to sayle in the
Laborynth, the water beeing enuyroned vpon either sides, with roses,
trees, and fruits.

And hauing sayled the first seuen reuolutions of _Aries_, and being come
to the second mount, there they meet with innumerable troopes of yong
women of diuerse conditions, which demaund of euerie one the sight of
theyr honye, which beeing shewed vnto them, they straightwayes knowe the
propertie of the hony, and the goodnesse thereof, and embracing him as
theyr guest, they inuyte him with them to passe through the next seuen
reuolutions, and with diuerse exercises according to her inclyned
promptnes, they accompany them to the third mount.

In this place hee that will goe on forwards with his companion, shee
will neuer abandon or leaue him: for there bee farre more pleasaunt
voluptuous women. And many refuse the first and make choyse of them.

In the putting off from the second mount, to come to the third, they
finde the current of the water somewhat agaynst them, and stand in neede
of oares, but beeing fallen off from the thirde mount, making theyr
course towardes the fourth, they finde the tide and streame more against
them, and in these seauen oblique courses their pleasure is variable and
vnconstant.

Beeing come to the fourth mount, they finde other yoong women combatting
and fighting, and those examining theyr pottes of honie, they intice
them to theyr exercise, but those that refuse to leaue theyr first
companions, they let passe together, and in this cyrcuite the water is
yet more contrary and troublesome, where there is neede of great studie
and labour to passe on.

And beeing come to the fift mount, they finde it speculable, lyke a
mirrour wherein they see theyr representations, and in that they take
great delyght, and with a feruent desire they passe on their laboursome
course. In that mount they see this sentence and golden saying
manyfested, _Medium tenuere beati_: not lyneall, nor locall, but
temporall, where by a sincere and perfect examination hee discerneth
that meane wherewith he hath ioyned his felicitie, wisdome and riches:
which if not well, in the rest of his course he faynteth the more.

And losing off from thence, the Waters by reason of the broken circles,
beginne to be verie slyding towards the Center, so that with small or no
rowing they are brought to the sixt Mount. And there they finde elegant
Women, with a shew of heauenly modestie and diuine worship, with whose
amiable aspects and countenaunces, the Trauailers are taken in their
loue, condemning their former with despite and hatefull abhorrence. And
with these they fall acquainted, and passe the seauen reuolucions.

These beeing come ouer with an obscure and foggy close ayre, with many
losses and a grieuous voyage, they beginne to remember what they haue
past and lost: for the more that the compasse of the reuolucion, draweth
neere to the discouerie of the Figure of the Center, the sooner they are
passed ouer, styll shorter and shorter, and the more swyfter the course
of the streame is into the deuouring swallow of the Center.

And then with extreame affliction and bitter anguish remembring the
abuse of their pleasures, and companions that they haue forsaken, and
sweete places, which so much the more augmenteth their sorrowes, for
that they can not returne or goe backe with theyr Shyppe, such a
companie still follow them vppon the stearne with their fore-castles.
And most of all dysmayeth them the heauie sentence ouer the median
Center, _Theonlykos Dys Algetos_.

And there, considering the displeasant tytle, they curse the time of
their entrance into the Labirinth, which hath in it so manie sundry
delights, and the end of them subiect to such myserable and ineuitable
necessity.

And then she smyling, said: _Poliphilus_, ouer the deuouring throat of
thys Center, there sitteth a seuere Iudge, balancing euery ones actions,
and helping whom hee will helpe. And because that it will be tedious to
tell thee all, let thus much heereof suffise. Let vs goe downe to our
cõpanion _Thelemia_, who demanding the cause why they staid so long
aboue, _Logistica_ made aunswer, it doth not content our _Poliphilus_,
onely to behold, but also to vnderstand by me the secrecie of those
things, which he could not goe to knowe, wherein I haue satis-fied him.
And when she had ended, _Thelemia_ said.

Let vs goe a little while to an other garden no lesse pleasant ioyning
to the glasse garden, vppon the right side of the Pallas: and when wee
were come in thither, I was amazed with excessiue wondering, to see the
curiousnesse of the worke; as vneasie to report as vncredible to
beleeue: æquiuolent with that of glasse, wyth lyke disposition of
benches or bankes; theyr lyppes set out with coronising and golden
ground worke, and such trees, but that the boxes and Cyprus trees, were
all silke, sauing the bodies and greater branches, or the strength of
the armes: the rest, as the leaues, flowers, and outermost rynde, was of
fine silke, wanting no store of Pearles to beautifie the same: and the
perfect fine collour, smelling as the glasse flowers beforementioned,
and alike, but that they about compassing walles, of meruailous and
incredible sumpteousnesse, were all couered ouer with a crusting of
Pearle, close ioyned and set together: and towardes the toppe, there
sprouted out greene yuie, the leaues thickning and bushing out from the
Pearles, vvith the stringes and veines of golde, running vppe in diuers
places betwixt the Pearles, in a most rare and curious sort, as if it
had beene very growing yuie, with berries of precious stones sette in
the stalkes in little bunches: and in the bushes were Ringe-doues of
silke, as if they had beene feeding of the berries, all along the sides
of the square plotted garden walles: ouer the which, in master-like and
requisite order, stretched out the beame and Zophor of golde.

The plaine smoth of the settles, where-vpon the boxe trees stoode,
couered ouer with Histories of loue and venerie, in a worke of silke and
threddes of golde and siluer, in suche a perfect proportioned ymaginarie
and counterfaiting as none may goe beyonde. The ground of the leuell
garden, was of leaues, grasse, and flowers of silke, like a faire sweete
meddowe: in the midst whereof, there was a large and goodly round
Arbour, made with golde wyer, and ouerspread with roses of the lyke
worke, more beautifull to the eye, then if they had been growing roses,
vnder which couering, and within which Arbour about the sides, were
seates of red Diaspre, & all the round pauemẽt of a yellow Diaspre,
according to the largenes of the place, with dyuers colloured spottings,
confusedly agreeing together in pleasant adulterated vniting, and so
cleere and shining, that to euery obiect was it selfe gaine represented.
Vnder the which Arbour, the fayre and pleasant _Thelemia_, solaciously
sitting downe, tooke her Lute which she carryed with her, and with a
heauenly melodie and vn-hearde sweetenesse, she began to sing in the
commendation and delightes of her Queene. And seeing what a grace vnto
her, the company of her fellowe _Logistica_ was, I maruailed why
_Apollo_ came not to harken the Harmonie made by them: it was so
melodious, that for the present tyme a man woulde haue thought that
there had beene no greater fælicitie. And after that shee ended her
diuine Poems, _Logistica_ tooke me by the hande and led me foorth of the
Arbour, saying vnto me.

_Poliphilus_, thou shalt vnderstande that the deuise of these obiects,
are more pleasant to bee vnderstoode then behelde, and therefore lette
vs enter in heere, to bee satisfied in both.

And from thence, shee and her companion brought mee from thys garden to
an other, where I behelde an arching _Areostile_, from the ground bent
to the toppe, fyue paces in height and three ouer, and thus continued
rounde about the compasse of the garden, in an orderly and requisite
proportioning, all inuested and couered ouer with greene yuie, so that
no part of the wall was to be seene. And there were a hundred Arches to
the compassing of this garden.

By euery of the Arches, was an Aulter of red Porphirite, curiously
proportioned with exquisite lyneaments; and vppon euery one of them was
placed, an image of golde, like a Nymph, of rare and beautifull
semblances, diuersly apparelled, and varying in theyr attyre and heade
dressing, euery one bending their eyes towards the Center of the garden.

In which middle Centricke place, there was founded a Base, of a cleere
Christal-like Calcedonie stone, in a Cubic forme: that is, euery way a
like square. And vppon that was set a round stone, but flatte vppon both
sides, two foote high, and by the Diameter, one pace and a halfe ouer,
of most pure red Diaspre. Vppon the which, stoode a most blacke stone,
in forme three square, and in quantitie for breadth, fitting the rounde,
and in height one pace and a halfe. The corners of which triangle did
iumpe with the sides, and lymbus of the subiacent plynth or round stone.

In the smooth polished fronts of which triangle, there was appact a
beautifull Image, of a heauenly aspect, graue and modest, with their
feete not touching the stone, but standing out from the same iust ouer
the suppressed and vnder put rounde stone. Theyr statures as tall as the
trygonall would beare, vnto the which they did stick fast by their backe
parts. Theyr armes were stretched abroade, both the right and left to
the corners of the triangle, where they held a Coppy, filled and fastned
to the corners of the Trigonall, the length of euery one of which
Coppies of fine gold, was seauen foote.

And the Images, the Coppyes, and their bandes wherewith they were tyed
in the midst and held by, were all shyning, and their hands inuiluped
with the sundry stringes, flynging about the plaine smothe of the black
stone.

Their habits were Nymphish, of most rare and most excellent working. The
Sepulchre of _Tarnia_ the Queene of the _Scythians_ in _Asia_, was
nothing comparable.

In the lowest Cubicall Figure, vpon the smoth plaine of euery square,
were ingrauen Greeke Letters, three, one, two and three on thys sort.
ΔΥΣ Α ΛΩ ΤΟΣ.

  [Illustration]

In the circular there were three Characters Hieragliphicall,
perpendicularly vnder the feet of euerie Image. For the first, was
impressed the forme of the Sonne. Next vnder another, the figure of an
olde fashioned Ower.

Thirdly, a dyshe with a burning flame in it.

Vpon the heade of the trygonall blacke stone, towarde euerie corner,
I did behold an Egiptian Monster of Gold, fower footed couchant. One of
thẽ hauing a face lyke man altogether. The other like half a man, &
halfe a beast. And the third like a beast. VVith a linnen vaile ouer
euery of their heades, with two Labels hanging ouer theyr eares, & the
rest descending downe and couering their necks & backes, with the bodies
of Lyons. Theyr lookes directly forward.

Vppon the backs of these three, dyd stande rysing vp a massiue Spyre of
Gold, three square, sharpning vp to the toppe, fiue tymes as high as
broade below. And vpon euery front or foreside, was grauen a circle, and
ouer one circle a Greeke Letter, Ο. ouer another, a Letter Ω. and ouer
the third, a Greeke Ν.

There _Logistica_ beganne to speake vnto me, saying, by these Figures
are discribed, so farre as mans reason can shewe, the celestiall
harmony. And vnderstand _Poliphilus_, that these Figures, with a
perpetuall affynitie and coniunction, are auncient Monuments, and
Egiptian Hieragliphs, signifying this, _Diuinæ infinitæque trinitati
vnius essentiæ_. Which is now by his holy word, in a most louing sort
manifested to the whole world, according to his will: and yet it shall
not be a misse to see antiquities, and consider what greater benefite is
had by the precious Gospel.

The lower Figure was consecrated to the Deitie, because it is euerie way
alike, and all one: and vpon euery side, and turned euery way, of like
stablenes, vpon euery base, constant and permanent.

The round Circular standing vppon that, is without beginning or ende.
Vppon the circumferent sides whereof, these three lyneaments are
contained, directly vnder euerie Image, according to the property
attributed.

The Sunne with his comfortable light, giueth life to euerie thing, and
his nature is attributed to GOD.

The second is the Ower, which is prouident direction, and gouernment of
all with an infinite wisedome.

The third is a Fyerie Vessell, whereby is vnderstoode a partycipation of
Loue.

And although that they be three distinct things, yet they are contained
& vnited in one sempeternallie, with great loue communicating their
blessings, as you may see by the coppies at euery corner of the
trygonall stone.

And continuing her delectable speech, shee sayd, vnder the forme of the
Sunne, note this Greeke worde, _Adiegetos_. By the Ower looke vpon this,
_Adiachoristos_. And by the Vessel of fier, was engrauen, _Adiereynes_.

And to this ende are the three Monsters placed vnder the golden
Obelisque, because that there be three great opinions like those
Monsters: & as that with the humane countenaunce is best, so the other
be beastly and monstrous.

In the Spyre there be three plaine sides, lyneated with three circles,
signifying one for euery time. The past, the present, and to come; and
no other figure can holde these three circles, but in that inuariable.
And no mortall man can at one instant perfectlie discerne and see
together two sides of the same figure, sauing one integrally, which is
the Present: and therefore vppon great knowledge were these three
Characters engrauen, Ο. Ω. Ν.

For which cause _Poliphilus_, not that I excuse my selfe for beeing ouer
prolix and tedious, but briefely to teach thee, and sette thee right vp.
In the knowledge heereof, thou shalt vnderstand, that the first basiall
Figure is onely knowne to hymselfe, and to one Sonne of man, which hath
a humane bodie glorifyed and without sinne: and the brightnes thereof
wee see but as in a glasse, and not cleerely as it is, for that it is
incomprehensible for a fynite substance.

But he that is indued with wisedome, let him consider of the glorious
brightnes thereof. But to the thirde Figure, which is of a darke and
blacke collour, wherein be the three golden Images: _The Blacke stone is
the Lawe: the Coppies foode: the three Women the preseruation of
Man-kind._

Nowe they which will looke higher, they see a Figure in a tryne aspect,
and the higher that they goe towardes the toppe, where the vnion of the
three is, be they neuer so wise, their vnderstanding is vnperfect: and
although that they see it, yet they knowe not what they see, but that
there is such a thing, in comparison whereof, they are fooles, theyr
power weake, and themselues nothing.

And there _Logistica_ hauing ended her allowed talke, proceeding from an
absolute knowledge, deepe iudgement, and sharpnesse of wit in Diuine
matters, and vnknowne to weake capacities, I began heereat to take
greater delight, then in any other meruailous worke what soeuer, that I
had graciously beholden with my greedy eyes. Considering with my selfe
of the mysticall Obelisque, the ineffable equality statarie, for
durablenesse and perpetuitie vnmoueable, and enduring vncorruptible.

Where there breathed a sweet ayre from heauen, with vnuariable windes,
in this Garden round about full of flowers, of a large and circular
permanent plot: compassed about with all sorts of fruites, pleasant in
taste and full of health; with a perpetuall greenesse, disposed and set
by a regular order, both beautifull, pleasant, and conuenient; with the
perfect labour and indeuour of Nature to bring it to that passe, and
beautified with precious gold.

And _Logistica_ holding her peace, they tooke mee both by the hands, and
we went out at the mouth of one of the Arches from the precyncts of the
Iuied inclosure. And beeing gone from thence, very contentedly passing
on betwixt them both, saith _Thelemia_, let vs now hasten on to our
three Gates whether we are sent.

Where-vpon, we passing through a plentiful seate and pleasant Countrey,
with a reasonable conuenient pace, I beheld the heauens very cleere &
bright, & beguiled the tyme with merry, sweet, and delightfull
discourses. And I desirous to vnderstand euery particular of the
inestimable riches, vnspeakeable delights and incomparable treasure of
the sacred Queene, (to the which _Osyris_ the builder of the two Temples
of Golde, one to _Iupiter_, and the other to the kingdome, must giue
place,) I mooued this question.

Tell me I beseech you fayre Nymphes, (if my curiosity bee not to your
discontentment) amongst all the precious stones that I could perfectly
behold of great estimation and pryce, one I deemed inestimable, and
without comparison most precious; The Iasper which had the effigies of
_Nero_ cut, it was not much bigger. Neither was the Coruscant to passe
in the statue of _Arsinoe_ the _Arabian_ Queene equall with it. Next
her, of such value was the Iewell, wherein was the representation of
_Nonius_ the Senator, as this sparkling and shyning Dyamond, of a rare
and vnseene beautie and bignes, which did hang vpon a rich Carkenet
about the snowie necke of the sacred Queene, what cutting was in the
same, which I could not perceiue by meanes of the brightnesse and my
beeing some-what farre of. And therefore I beeing therein ignoraunt,
desyre to knowe the same.

_Logistica_ considering of my honest demaund, aunswered me
incontinently. Know this _Poliphilus_, in the Iewell was ingrauen an
imperiall throne, and in the throne the mighty name of _Iehouah_ in
Hebrew Letters, and before that throne, are cast downe and troden vnder
foote, the Gyants which proudly haue lift vp themselues against his
worde, and resisted hys will: vppon the left side of the throne is a
flame of fire, vppon the right hande a horne of saluation, or Copie full
of all good blessednes, and this is all that is contained in the Iewell.

Then I presumed further to knowe, what should these two things vpon
eyther sides of the throne signifie, that were holden out in two handes.
_Thelemia_ quickly aunswered me, God of his infinite goodnesse,
proposeth to mankind his mercie and his iudgement, chuse which they
will.

For thys beeing satis-fied, I sayd moreouer. Seeing that most gracious
Nymphs, my speeches be not displeasant vnto you, and that I am not yet
satis-fied in all that I haue seene, I pray you let me vnderstand this.

Before the horrible feare that I was driuen into by the Dragon, I beheld
a mighty huge Elephant of stone, with an entrance into his bellie, where
were two Sepulchres, with a wryting, the meaning wherof is too mysticall
for me, that was, that I shoulde not touch the bodie, but take away the
head.

_Logistica_ forthwith made me aunswer. _Poliphilus_, I doe vnderstande
very well your doubt, and therefore you shall vnderstande, that this
monstrous shape and machine was not made without great and wonderfull
humane wisedome, much labour, and incredible diligence, with a
perplexibility of vnderstanding to knowe the mysticall conceite. Thou
remembrest that vpon the face there hung an ornament, with certaine
_Ideonix ionic_ and _Arabic_, which in our Mother-tongue, is as much to
say, as labour, and industrie. Signifying thereby, that in thys world,
whosoeuer will haue any blessing that shall do him good, he must leaue
the body, which is ease and idlenes, and betake himselfe to trauaile and
industry, which is the head.

Shee had no sooner ended her words both pleasant & piercing, but I
vnderstoode it very well and gaue her great thankes. And yet desirous to
be resolued in whatsoeuer I stood in doubt, and seeing that I might
speake boldly, I made this third question. Most wise Nymph, in my
comming out of the subterraneall vast darksome place, as I passed on,
I came to a goodlie bridge, and vppon the same, in a Porphyrite stone
vppon the one side, and an Ophite vpon the other, I beheld engrauen
certaine Hieragliphs, both which I did interprete, but I stoode
doubtfull of certaine branches, that were tyed to the hornes of the
scalpe of the Oxe, and the rather because they were in the Porphyrite
stone, and not in the Ophit vpon the other side.

She aunswered me straight way. The braunches, one is of the Thistle or
thorne of Iudea[A], and the other of the Turbentine. The nature of which
Woodes bee, that the one will not easily take fire, and the other will
neither bend, rotte, consume, nor be eaten with wormes. And so that
patience is commended, which with anger is not kindled, nor by aduersity
will bee subdued.

    [Sidenote A: The crown of thorne vpon Christes head.]

The nature of the Porphyrit stone is of this secrecie, that in the
fornace it will neither burne it selfe, but also causeth other stones
neere adioyning that they shall not burne. And of that nature is
patience, that it will neither be altered itselfe, nor suffer any other
wherein it beareth rule to fall into a furie. And the Ophite stone is of
such nature also.

Nowe _Poliphilus_, I doe greatly commende you, in that you are desirous
to vnderstand such secrets: for to behold, consider, and measure the
same, is a commendable vertue, and the way to knowledge: whereuppon I
had occasion giuen to render innumerable thanks, for her great and
fauourable curtesies.

And thus with allowed and delightfull discoursing speeches, we came to a
fayre Riuer, vpon the banck whereof, besides other fayre greene and
florishing Trees, and water hearbes, I beheld a fine Groue of Plane
Trees, in the which was an excellent fayre bridge ouer the Riuer made of
stone, with three Arches, with pyles bearing foorth against the two
fronts, to preserue the worke of the bridge, the sides thereof beeing of
excellent workmanship.

And in the middle bending of the same, vpon eyther sides, there was a
square stone of Porphyrite set, hauing in it a Catagliphic, engrauing of
Hieragliphies.

Vpon the right hand as I went ouer, I beheld a woman, casting abroade
her armes, sitting onely vppon one buttocke, putting foorth one of her
legges as if shee woulde rise; In her right hand, vpon that side which
shee did sitte, shee helde a payre of winges, and in the other hand,
vppon that side whereon she was arysing, a Tortice.

Right against her, there was a Circle, the center wherof two little
Spyrits did hold, with their backs turned towards the circumference of
the Circle.

And then _Logistica_ saide vnto me, _Poliphilus_, I am sure that thou
doost not vnderstand these Hieragliphs, but they make much for thy
purpose: and therfore they are placed for a Monument and thing to be
considered, of such as passe by.

The Circle _Medium tenuere beati_.

The other, temper thy hast by staying, and thy slownesse by rysing,
consider heereof as thou seest cause.

This bridge was built with a moderate bending, shewing the cunning
disquisition, tryall, examination, arte, and discretion of the excellent
workman and inuenter, commended in the continuaunce and durablenesse
thereof, which manie of our Bayard-like moderne Idiots, without
knowledge, measure and arte buzzing on, neither obserue proportion nor
lyneaments, but all out of order.

This bridge was all of pure Marble.

When wee had passed ouer the bridge, wee walked in the coole shadow,
delighted with the variable notes and chirpings of small byrds, to a
rocky and stony place, where high & craggie Mountaines lifted vp
themselues, afterwarde continuing to abrupt and wilesome hilly places,
full of broken and nybled stones, mounting vppe into the ayre, as high
as a man might looke to, and without any greene grasse or hearbe, and
there were hewen out the three gates, in the verie rocke it selfe, euen
as plaine as might be. A worke verie auncient and past record, in a very
displeasant seate.

Ouer euery one of the which, I beheld in Letters Ionic, Romaine, Hebrew
and Arabic, the tytle that the sacred Queene _Eleutherillida_ fore-told
me that I should find. The Gate vppon my right hand, had vpon it this
word, _Theodoxia_. That vppon my left hand, _Cosmodoxia_. And the
thirde, _Erototrophos_. Vnto the which as soone as we were come, the
Damosels beganne to instruct me in the tytles, and knocking in the
resounding leaues of the Gates, vppon the right hande couered ouer with
greene mosse, they were presently opened.

And ther dyd an olde woman present herselfe vnto vs, of an honourable
countenaunce, out of an olde dawbed and smoakie house, hauing a poore
base little doore, ouer the which was painted _Pilurania_. Shee came
with a modest and honest shamefastnesse, and her dwelling place was in a
solitarie site and shadie Rocke, decayed and crumbly, her clothes were
tattered, her face leane, pale & poore. Her eyes looking towards the
ground, her name was _Thende_. Shee had attending vpon her sixe
Handmaydes, basely and slenderly apparrelled. One was named _Parthenia_,
the second _Edosia_, an other _Hypocolinia_, the fourth _Pinotidia_, the
next _Tapinosa_, the last _Prochina_. Which reuerent Matron, with her
right arme naked poynted to the heauens.

She dwelt in a place very hard to come vnto, and ful of troubles to
passe on the way, beeing hyndered with thorne and bryers, very rough and
displeasant, a mistie clowde cast ouer it, and very hard to clymbe vp
into.

_Logistica_ perceiuing by my looke that I had no great lyking in this
place, some-what greeued therewith, said, this Rocke is knowne neuer but
at the end. And then _Thelemia_ sayde, _Poliphilus_, I see you make
small regarde of such a painefull woman. Whereat I assenting to her with
my countenaunce, wee departed, and the gate being shut we came to the
next.

Where knocking, it was presently opened, and wee entering in, there met
vs a browne woman, with fierce eyes rowling, and of a quicke
countenaunce, lyfting vp a naked glittering sworde, vpon the middle
wherof was a Crowne of golde, and a branche of Palme tree intrauersed.

Her armes brawnie like _Hercules_, in labour and acts magnanimious and
nobly minded. Her belly small. A little mouth, strong and stooping
shoulders, by her countenaunce seeming to bee of an vndaunted minde, not
fearing to vndertake any enterprise how hard soeuer.

Her name was _Euclelia_, verie honourablie attended vppon with sixe
young Women. The first was called _Merimnasia_, the second, _Epitide_,
another, _Ergasilea_, the fourth, _Anectea_, the fift was named
_Statia_, the last was called _Olistea_.

The situation and place me thought was painefull, and _Logistica_
perceiuing my inclynation, presentlie tooke into her hand _Thelemias_
Lute, and beganne to strike a doricall tune, and sung to the same verie
sweetly, saying. O _Poliphilus_ be not wearie to take paynes in thys
place, for when labour and trauell is ouer-come, there will be a tyme of
rest. And her songe was of such force, that I was euen consenting to
remaine there, notwithstanding that, the habitation seemed laboursome.
Wherevppon, _Thelemia_ inticingly said vnto me, I think that it standeth
with verie great reason my _Poliphilus_, that before you set downe your
rest heere in this place, you ought in any case to see the third Gate.

Whereunto I consented with a very good will, and therefore going out
from hence, we came to the other Gate, where _Thelemia_ knocking at a
ring of Brasse, it was forth-with sette open, and when wee were come in,
there came towardes vs a notable goodly woman, and her name was
_Philtronia_.

Her regards were wanton, lasciuious, and vnconstant, her grace
wonderfull pleasant, so as at the verie first sight shee violently drew
me into her loue.

This place was the Mansion-house of Voluptuousnes. The grounde decked
with small hearbes, and adorned with all sorts of sundrie flowers,
abounding with solace and quiet ease. Issuing and sending foorth in
diuers places small streames of water, pyppling and slyding downe vpon
the Amber grauell in theyr crooking Channels heere and there, by some
suddaine fall making a still continued noyse, to great pleasure
moystning the open fieldes, and making the shadowed places vnder the
leaffye Trees, coole and fresh.

Shee had with her also sixe young women of like statures, passing fayre,
of pleasant countenaunces, amorously adorned, and dressed as may bee
desired of an ambitious beautie and gesture.

The first was called _Rastonelia_. The second, _Cortasina_. The thirde,
_Idonesa_. The fourth, _Triphelia_. The fift, _Epiania_. And the last
was named _Adia_.

These and their companie, were very delightfull to my gasing and
searching eyes. VVhere-vppon _Logistica_ presentlie with a sad and
grieued countenaunce, seeing mee disposing my selfe abruptlie to the
seruile loue of them, shee said vnto mee, O _Poliphilus_, the alluring
and inticing beauties of these, are vaine, deceiueable, and
counterfeited, vnsauorie and displeasant, and therefore if thou wouldest
with aduisement looke vppon their backes, thou wouldest then hate,
contemne, and abhorre theyr lothsome filthinesse and shame, abounding in
stinke and noysome sauoure aboue any dunghill, which no stomacke can
abide.

And therefore what is slypperie and transitorie flye and eschewe,
despise that pleasure which bringeth shame and repentance, vaine hopes,
a short and small ioy, with perpetuall complaynts, doubtfull sighes, and
a sorrowful life neuer ending.

Oh adulterated and vnkindly pleasure, fraught with miserie, contayning
such bitternesse, like honnie, and yet gall dropping from greene leaues.

O lyfe worse then death, and yet deadly, delighted in sweete poyson,
with what care, sorrow, pensiue thoughts, mortall and desperate
attempts, art thou sought for to bee obtained by blind Louers, who
without regarde or aduise cast themselues headlong into a gulfe of
sorrowes.

They be present before thine eyes, and yet thou seest them not. Oh what
and howe great sorrowes, bitter and sharpe paine and vexation doost thou
beare, wicked, execrable and accursed appetite.

O detestable madnesse, oh beguiled senses, by your faulte with the selfe
same beastlie pleasure, myserable mortall men are ouerthrowne.

Oh filthy lust, absurd furie, disordinate and vaine desire, building
nests with errours, and torments for vvounded harts, the vtter
destroyer, and idle letting goe by of all good blessings.

Oh blinde Monster, how doost thou blinde, and with what deceipt doost
thou couer the eyes, and deceiue the vnderstanding sences of vnhappie
and miserable Louers with vailes and mystes.

O monstrous and slauish, which compassed with so manie euils, hastenest
to so small pleasure poysoned and fayned.

_Logistica_ speaking with vehemencie these and such lyke words, her
fore-head frowning, wrympling with sorrowes, and veines, rysing vp in a
great rage, shee cast her Lute vppon the ground and brake it.

VVhere-vppon _Thelemia_, with a smyling countenaunce, nodded towards
mee, as if shee shoulde say, let _Logistica_ speake her pleasure, but
doe as you see good your selfe.

And _Logistica_ seeing my wicked intent and resolute determination,
beeing kindled with disdaine, turned her backe, and with a great sigh
hastened away.

And I remained still with my companion _Thelemia_, vvho with a
flattering and smyling grace said vnto me, _Poliphilus_, this is the
place where thou shalt not continue long, but thou shalt finde the
deerest thing which thou louest in the world, & which thou hast in thy
hart, without intermission determined to seeke and desire.

And doubtfully then discoursing with my selfe, I was resolued that
nothing coulde breede quiet, or bring content to my poore grieued hart,
but my best desired _Polia_. The promise and warrantise of _Thelemia_
for my obtayning the same, bred in mee some comfort.

And shee perceiuing that the Mistris of thys place, and the seate it
selfe, and her Women dyd bothe please mee vvell, and entertained mee
courteously, shee kissing mee, tooke her leaue and gaue me a fare-well.

The metallyne gates beeing shut, I remayned incloystered among these
fayre and beautifull Nymphes, who began very pleasantly and wantonly to
deuise with mee: and beeing hemmed in with their lasciuious company,
I found my selfe prouoked by their perswasiue alluring intisements, to
vnlawfull concupiscence, feeling in my selfe a burning desire, kyndled
with their wanton aspects, an increasing prouocation of a lusting fier.
I doubt me that if _Phrine_ had beene of that fauour, and force in
gesture of speech, colde _Xenocrates_ would haue consented to her
alluring, and not haue beene accused by her, to be an image of stone.
Their countenances were so lasciuious, their breastes naked and
intycing, theyr eyes flattering, in their roseall forheads, glystering
and rowling, their shapes most excellent, their apparell rich, their
motions girlish, theyr regards byting, theyr ornaments, sweete and
precious, no part counterfeited, but all perfected by nature in an
excellent sort, nothing deformed, but all partes aunswerable one to an
other.

Their heades yellowe, their tresses fayre, and the hayre soft and fine,
in such a sort dressed vp and rouled into trammels, with laces of silke
and golde, passing any ioye that a man may beholde, turned about their
heads in an excellent manner, inuiluxed, and bound vppe together, their
forheades compassed about and shaddowed with wauering curles, mouably
præpending in a wonderfull manner, marueilous delightfull, perfumed &
sweet, yeelding an vnknown fragrancie. Their speeches so perswasorie and
pleasing, as might robbe the fauour of an indesposed hart, and violently
drawe vnto them any mind, though Satyr-like or churlish howsoeuer,
to depraue Religion, to binde euery loose conceit, to make any rusty
Peasant amorous, and to mollifie any froward disposition. Vppon which
occasion, my minde, altogether set on fier with a new desire, and in the
extreame heate of concupiscence, prouoked to fall headlong into a
lasciuious appetite, & drowned in lustfull loue vnbridled: in the
extreame inuasion and infectious contage thereof, the Damoselles
forsooke mee and left me all alone in a fruitfull playne.




_In this place Poliphilus being left alone, a most fayre Nymphe (when
  hee was forsaken of the lasciuious company) came vnto him, whose
  beautie and apparell Poliphilus dooth amourously describe._


My tender heart thus excessiuely wounded with amorous prouocation,
I think I was mad, I stood so amazed, or blinde at the least, because
that I coulde not perceiue in what sort or how this desired and
delightfull company gaue mee the slip: and at last not knowing what I
did, but casting mine eyes right forward, I behelde before mee, a fine
Arbour of sweete Gessamine, somewhat high, lifting vppe and bending
ouer, all to bee painted and decked with the pleasant and odoriferous
flowers of three sortes commixt, and entring in vnder the same.
Wonderfully perplexed for the losse of my company, I knewe not howe
or in what sort, and calling to remembraunce the diuers, rare and
wonderfull thinges past, and aboue al the great hope and trust which
I had conceiued vpon the Queenes promise, that I should finde my loue
_Polia_.

Alas said I, with a deepe sigh, my _Polia_, that the greene Arbour
resounded againe therewithall, my amourous breathings were such, framed
within and sent out from my burning hart. And I was no sooner entered
into this agony, and ouerwhelmed in this passion, but as I passed on to
the other ende of the Arbor, I might perceiue a farre off, a great
number of youthes, solacing and sporting themselues very loude with
diuers melodious soundes, with pleasant sports and sundry pastimes, in
great ioye, and passing delight assembled together, in a large playne.
Vppon this gratefull and desired noueltie, I set me down marueiling at
it, before I would step any further on.

And beholde, a most noble and faire Nymph, with a burning torch in her
hand, departing from the company, tended her course towardes mee, so as
I might well perceiue that shee was a reall mayde indeede and no
spirite, whervpon I mooued not one whit, but gladly expected her
comming, who with a maidenly hast, modest accesse, star-like
countenance, and smiling grace, drewe neere vnto mee with such a
Maiestie, and yet friendly, so as I doubt me, the amorous _Idalea_ neuer
shewed her selfe to _Mars_, nor to her the fayre Pastor _Adonis_. Nor
the delicate _Ganimed_ to _Iupiter_, or the fayre _Psyches_, to her
spouse _Cupid_.

For which cause, if shee had beene the fourth among the three contending
Goddesses, if _Joue_ had beene Iudge, as in the shady Wooddes of
_Mensunlone_ was the Phrigian Sheepheard, without all doubt she had
beene iudged of farre more excellent beautie, and without equiuolence,
more worthy of the golden apple, then all or any one of the rest. At the
first sight I was perswaded that shee had beene _Polia_, but the place
vnaccustomed & her apparell made mee thinke the contrarie, and therefore
my doubtfull iudgement remained in suspence, hauing onely a reuerent
suspition therof.

This honourable Nymph, had her virgineall diuine and small body couered
with a thinne subtill stuffe of greene silke, powdered with golde, vppon
a smocke of pure white coorled Lawne, couering her most delicate and
tender body, and snowye skinne, as fine and good as euer _Pamphila_ the
daughter to _Platis_ in the Iland of Coo, did inuent to weaue. Which
white smocke seemed as if it had couered damaske Roses.

The coate which she wore ouer that, was not like our fashioned
petticoates with French wastes, for that her sweete proporcioned body
needed no such pinching in, & vnholsome weare, hyndering procreation and
an enemie to health: but rather like a wastcoate, with little plightes
and gathers vnder her rounde and pretty bearing out breasts, vpon her
slender and small waste, ouer her large proportioned flanckes and little
round belly, fast girded about with a girdle of golde: and ouer the
same, a gowne or garment side to the ground, and welted belowe.

This garment beeing very side, was taken vp round about the pitch of her
hippes, and before vpon her belly, & tyed about with the studded
marriage girdle of _Citherea_, the plucking vp of y^e garment, bearing
ouer the girdle about her like a french vardingale, & the nethermost
part falling down about her feet in plightes and fouldes, vnstable and
blowne about with the sweete ayre & coole winde, causing sometime, by
the thinnesse thereof, her shape to be seene in it, which shee seemed
with a prompt readinesse to resist and hynder. Her beautie and grace was
such, as I stoode in doubt whether shee were begotten by any humaine
generation: her armes stretching downe, her handes long and slender, her
fingers small and fayre, and her nayles thinne and ruddy, and shining,
as if she had beene _Minerua_ her selfe. Her armes to be seene through
the cleere thinnesse of the Lawne, the winges about the size of her
garment where her armes came out, were of golde, in an excellent sort
and fashion welted, and set with Pearle and stone: and in like sort, all
the hemming about of her vesture, with golde ooes, and Pearle, and
spangles of golde in diuers places, distantly disposed in a curious and
pleasant sort to beholde.

Vppon either side, vnder the armes to her waste, her vpper garment was
vnsowed and open, but fastened with three buttons of great Orient Pearle
(such as _Cleopatra_ neuer had to dissolue in a Potion) in loopes of
blewe silke, so that you might see her smocke betweene the distance of
one Pearle from an other, couering her daintie soft snowye thinne
skinne: except her small necke and the vpper halfe of her spatious and
delitious breast, more desired and contenting mine eyes, then the water
brookes and coole Ryuers to the emboste and chased Hart, more pleasing
then the fisher boate of _Endimion_ to _Cynthia_, and more pleasant then
_Cithera_ to _Orpheus_.

The sleeues of her smocke of a conuenient largenesse, and about her
wristes plighted and tyed with Bracelets of Golde, double and vnited
with Orient Pearle. And besides all her ornaments and gracious gestures,
she indeuoured nowe and then with stolen and affected regards, in a
sweet & pleasant sort, to cast down her eyes vpon her little round
swelling breastes, impatient at the suppressing of her soft and fine
apparell: so as I iudged vppon good consideration, and thought that in
the dignitie and honourable frame of her personage, the Creator had
framed and vnited together, all the violence of Loue. The foure Nourses
of the royall Kingdome of Babilon, called _The tongue of the Gods_, had
not that powre to winne fauour and loue of the King, which this most
sweet Nymph had.

About her fayre Necke, more white then the Scithian snowe, shee wore a
Carkenet of Oryent Pearle: _Cerna_ the wife of _Cæsar_ neuer had the
like, and I doubt me that that of _Eriphile_, which she tooke to
_Amphiaraus_, was nothing comparable vnto it. And in the bending downe
ouer the deuision of her breastes, betwixt two great Pearles, there was
laced a corruscant rounde Rubie, and vppon the collaterate sides of the
sayde Pearles, two glistering Saphires, and two Pearles, next them two
Emeraldes, & two Pearles, and after them two fayre Iacinthes: all these
Pearles and Stones were laced in a worke in losenges, in a rare and
beautifull manner.

Her fayre heade, sending downe and vnfolding a loose spreading abroade
of plentifull hayre, like the smallest threds of golde, wauing with the
winde, and vpon her crowne, a garland of tawny vyolets sweetly smelling,
and couering the same almost to her forheade: from the middle vpper
point whereof, in forme of two Hemycycles to the halfe of her eares, it
mounted vppe in curled trammelles, falling downe againe vppon her fayre
Temples, moueably wauing and shaddowing the same, and hyding the vpper
halfe of her small eares, more fayre then euer was reported of
_Mimoria_.

The rest of her yellowe haire, descended downe ouer her fayre necke,
well disposed shoulders, and straight backe, to the calues of her
slender legges, moderatly wauing and blowne abroad, in greater beautie
than the proude eyed feathers of _Iunoes_ Birde. Such hayre as
_Berenice_ did neuer vow in the venereous Temple for her _Tholomaus_,
nor _Conus_ the Mathematrician did euer beholde the like placed in the
Triangule.

In her forehead, vnder two subtile blacke Hemycicles and distinct eye
brees, such as _Abacsine_ in Æthiopia had not to boast of, or compare
with, nor _Juno_ her selfe, did looke out and present themselues two
pleasant radious and glistering eyes, which would enforce _Jupiter_ to
rayne golde, of a cleere sight, quicke and pearcing, with a browne
circle betwixt the Apple and the milchie white: neere to the which, were
her purple and Cherry cheekes, beautified with two round smyling
dimples, gracing the pleasure of her countenaunce, of the collour of the
fresh Roses gathered at the rysing of the Sunne, and layde in a vessell
of the Christall of Cyprus, and shewing through the same, as me thought.

Vnder her nose to her lyppes, passed a little valley to her small mouth
of a most sweete forme, her lyppes not blabbered or swelling, but
indifferent, & of a rubye collour, couering two vniforme sets of teeth,
like yuory, and small, not one longer and sharper than an other, but in
order euenly disposed and set: from betwixt the which, Loue had composed
an euerlasting sweet breathing, so as I presumed to thinke, that the
snow white teeth betwixt her gracious lyppes, were no other but Oryent
Pearles, & her sweet breath hot Muske, and by her delightfull voyce that
she was _Thespis_ with her nine daughters.

By all which sight I was greatly mooued and my sences rauished with a
kindled appetite, causing among them great strife and bitter contention,
such as I neuer felt before, by any other presence or excellent sightes
whatsoeuer. My searching eyes commended one part aboue another, to bee
more beautifull: but my appetite rapt into an other part of her heauenly
body, esteeming that aboue the other. And thus my insatiable and wanton
eyes, were the euill beginning of all thys perturbing and contentious
commotion, whome I founde the seminaries and moouers of all so great
strife and trouble, in my wounded and festering heart. Through theyr
contumacy, I was now brought from my selfe, and neuerthelesse, I could
not be satisfied by them. My greedy appetyte extolled her delicate
breast aboue any comparison, my eyes delightfully consenting thervnto,
sayd, at least by that we may discouer what y^e rest is; And they,
glauncing from that to the regarde of her grace and gesture, set all
their delight therein: and my appetite strengthened and not easilie
remooued from thence, I perswaded my selfe, that the plentie and
fayrenesse of her head and hayre, and the dressing thereof, and the
beautie of her forheade, coulde neuer bee compared with of any one or
other, like the scrapings of golde alwaies turning into little roundels.

With two eyes lyke morning starres in a cleere heauen, more beautifully
adorning her heade, than any that euer the warlike _Neco_ behelde among
the _Acitanians_, wounding my heart like one of the arrowes of the
angrie _Cupid_. And thus to conclude, I dare be bolde to say, that no
mortall man hath seene, so gracious, so shyning, so cleere and pleasant
lightes as these were placed in the forhead of this heauenly creature;
so that by them my hart was taken prisoner, & was filled with such
continuall cõtrouersies of desire, as if a leafe of the Laurell of the
Tombe of the king of _Bibria_ had bin placed betwixt, & that strife
should neuer cease whilst it was there: so as I thought that this strife
would neuer cease, vntill the pleasure were taken away, by reason
wherof, I could not perceiue howe I shoulde obtaine the fulnes of my
desire, or howe it coulde agree with either one or other. Like one
extreamely hungry among a number of prepared meates being desirous of
all, feedes of none, his burning appetite remayning satisfied with none,
but still hungry.




_The most fayre Nymph beeing come to Poliphilus, bearing a Torch in her
  left hand, with the other tooke him and inuited him to walke with her,
  and there Poliphilus by her loue was more inflamed._


Thus seing before me, a reall and visible obiect of a most excellent
representation, louely presence and heauenly aspect, of a plentifull
store and vniuersall gathering of vnseene beautie, and inhumaine
comelinesse, I made light and slender account, in respect heereof, of
all the inestimable delights, riches, and great pompe which before I had
behelde and seene, thinking their worthinesse nothing to speake of, in
comparison of this. Oh happie hee that may enioy such and so great a
treasure of loue; and not onely a happie possessor I account him, but
most happie that shall possesse and obtaine her obedience, to hys desire
and rule. But if _Zenes_ had behelde this substance, hee would haue
commended the same aboue all the _Agrigentine_ maides, euery proprotion
would haue made vnto him an oportune shewe of the absolutest perfection
in the whole world.

Which fayre and heauenly Nymph nowe comming neere vnto me, with a
cheerefull countenance, incontinently her most rare beautie, before
somewhat a farre of looked vppon with mine eyes, but nowe, by them more
neere and narrowly behelde, I was rauished and amased.

And her amorous aspect and louely presence, was no sooner brought by the
message of mine eyes to my inward partes, but my recording and watchfull
remembrance, stirring and waking vppe my heart, presenting and offering
her vnto the same: it is become her shoppe; the quiuer for her piercing
arrowes and wounding regardes, and the dwelling place and conseruable
mansion house, of her sweete picture. Knowing that this was shee which
had tædiously consumed my tender yeeres, in her hotte and prime loue,
not to be resisted. For I felt the same leaping and beating against my
breast, without ceasing, like as one that striketh vpon a hoarse Taber.
And still me thought by her louely and delightfull countenance, by her
fayre tresses, and the curling and wauing haire, playing vp and downe
vppon her forheade, that it should be _Polia_, whome so greatly I had
loued and desired, and for whom I had sustained so many & sundry
griefes, without intermission, sending out scalding sighes, the outward
reporters of my inwarde flames. But her rich and Nymphish habite,
vnaccustomed, and the place vnknowne and strange, made mee still
doubtfull and suspicious.

Shee (as beforesaide) carried in her snowe white left arme, close to her
body, a kindled and burning Torch, somewhat higher then her heade a good
deale, and the lower ende growing smaller and smaller, shee helde in her
hande: and stretching foorth that which was at libertie, more white then
euer had _Pelopea_, wherein appeared the thinne smoothnes of the skynne,
and the blewnesse of the veynes lyke Azure streames, vppon the faire and
whitest paper. Shee tooke me by the left hande with a sweete and louing
countenance and smiling grace, and with an eloquent speech, shee
pleasantly saide in this manner.

_Poliphilus_, I thinke my selfe to come in saftie, but it seemeth that
you stand doubtfull. Heereat I was more amazed, and my sences in a
manner gone to imagine howe she should knowe my name; and al my inward
parts vanquished, and hemmed in with burning amorous flames, my speech
was taken from mee with feare and reuerent bashfulnesse.

In this sort remayning, I knewe not vppon the suddaine what good
aunswere I might make, or otherwise doe her reuerence, but to offer her
my vnworthy and vnfit hande; Which when it was streined in hers, me
thought that it was in hot snowe and curded milke, and me thought
indeede, that I touched and handled something which was more then
humaine; which when I had so done, I remained moued in minde, troubled
and doubtfull, vnaccustomed to such a companion, not knowing what to
say, or whether to followe her, in my simple apparell and homely
bringing vp, not agreeable with hers: and as a foole, vnworthy and vnfit
for her fellowship, perswading my selfe, that it was not lawfull for a
mortall and earthly creature to enioy such pleasures. For which cause,
my collour red and blushing, with reuerent admiration, being grieued at
my basenesse, I setled my selfe to followe her.

At length, and yet not with a perfect recalled minde, I beganne to
reduce and sommon together, my fearefull and distempered spirites:
perswading my selfe, that I must needes haue good successe, being neere
so faire and diuine an obiect, and in such a place; And so followed her
on with a panting heart, more shaking than the birde _Sisura_, or a
Lambe carryed in the mouth of a Wolfe.

And thus touched most feruently with pleasant heates, growing &
encreasing more & more, they began to boyle & kindle my colde feare, and
dispositiuely to adopt my altered heate to sincere loue. Which being
thus brought to thys passe, by a prouoked inward desire, yet inwardly as
I reasoned with my selfe, it was wonderfully variable and doubtfull. Oh
most happye Louer of all Louers, that in requitall of hys, might bee
sure to participate of hers.

On the other side, I perswaded my selfe, that if I shoulde offer vnto
her my amorous heart and loue, hauing no better thing to bestow vpon
her, or present vnto her, it might be that she would not refuse it: like
_Artaxerxes_, the King of the Percians; who hauing water presented to
hys handes, accepted of it bowing downe himselfe. Heerewithall, me
thought yet that a fearefull and chill trembling inuaded mee, infusing
it selfe ouer all my body and breast, renewing the force of the extreame
fire, euen like dry reede: which being once kindled, is enflamed and
nourished with the fresh ayre, vntill at length it is increased so
mightily, that it consumeth all to ashes.

And in like sorte, I fully founde in my selfe, an increase and flashing
abroade of my inwarde flames, in their prepared subject, so effectually,
that her amorous regardes gaue me mortall and deadly woundes: euen as
lightning and thunder, among the stronge and mightie oakes, suddainely
with a great force, scorching & tearing them. And therefore I durst not
looke vpon her bright eyes, because that dooing so, (being ouercome with
the incredible beauty of her gracious aspect) if peraduenture her
radious beames did reincounter mutually with myne, for a little while
euery thinge seemed two vnto mee, vntill I had closed the lyddes
together, and restored them to theyr former light.

Wherevpon, and by reason of these thinges captiuated, spoyled, and
ouercome, I determined at that instant to plucke vp some fresh flowers,
and in all humble sort to offer them vnto her, and it came to passe,
that whilst my secret thoughts consented thervnto, consygning a free
meane and large entrance, for the discouery of my desire. But my burning
heart humbly hauing opened the same, euen as a rype Apple being eyther
bytten or shaken, so it fell and fayled me. And receiuing into his
wounded and familiar estuation, in some interposition of time,
immediatly his accustomed heat and feruor increased, piercing the inward
parts with her virgineall aspects, exceedingly beautified with a comely
grace and vnexcogitable elegancie; Because, that into this sweete
introduction into my minde, of these first amorous flames, (lyke the
Troian horse, full of weapons and deceite) the enterance was made for an
euerlasting, vnknown, and vncessant plague, deeply festering in my
tender and poore heart, perpetually remayning: which easily ouercome
with one sweete looke, inconsiderately without delay, hasteneth his owne
hurt, and wholly layeth it selfe open to amorous incursions, and burneth
it selfe with sweet conceits, going into the flames of his owne accord.

To all which burning desires her present company did greatly inforce
mee, which I esteemed to yeelde mee more comfort, then the North starre
in a tempestuous night to the troubled Marriner: more acceptable then
that of _Melicta_ to _Adonis_, or to _Phrodites_, the obsequious Nymph
_Peristera_: and more delightfull then _Dittander_ to the daughter of
_Dydo_, with the Purple flowre for the wounde of _Pius Æneas_: And
finding my heart strooken and inwardly pricking, secretly filled and
compressiuely stuft; recording and gathering together into it, varyable
thoughts and working of Loue, my immedicable wounde grewe greater and
greater. But gathering vp the remaynder of my sences, as one that durst,
I assured my selfe to manifest and lay open before her, my intended
desires and amorous conceites. And thus loosing my selfe in a blinde
folly. I could not choose but giue place to my inuading desires,
feruently boyling and inforcing me to say thus.

Oh delycate and heauenly Damosell, whatsoeuer thou art, thy forcyble
loue hath set me on fire, and consumeth my grieued heart; I finde my
selfe all ouer, burning in an vncessant flame, and a sharpe dart cast
into the middest of my breast, where it sticketh fast, hauing made a
mortall wounde vncurable. And hauing spoken thus, to the ende I might
discouer vnto her my hidden desire, and moderate by that meanes the
extreamitie of my bitter passions: vvhich I felt, the more they were
concealed, the more to augment and increase, I patiently helde my peace:
and by this meanes all those feruent and greeuous agitations, doubtfull
thoughtes, wanton and vyolent desires, were somewhat supprest; with my
ill fauoured Gowne, that had still some of the Bramble leaues and
prickes in the Wood hanging vpon it, and euen as a Peacocke in the pride
of his feathers, beholding the fowlenesse of his feete, pulleth downe
hys traine: so I considering the inequallitie of my selfe, with such a
heauenly obiect, appaled the prouocations of my contumacious and high
desires, looking into the vanities of my thoughtes.

And then I earnestly endeuoured by all the meanes that I might, to
subdue, encloyster, and keepe in, my vnbridled gadding appetite,
wandring minde, and immodest desire, intending nowe that it should neuer
be vttered againe.

At length I beganne to thinke in the secret depth of my wounded heart,
that vndoubtedly this my present continued griefe, was equall with that
of wicked _Tantalus_, to whose hotte and thirsting lyppes, the coole and
cleere water did offer it selfe, and to his hungry appetite, the sweete
fruites honge ouer hys gaping mouth appresenting, but he neuer tasted
any of either.

Ah woe is mee euen in like sort, a most fayre Nymph of an excellent
shape, of a florishing age, of Angel-like behauiour vnspeakable, and of
rare honour and exceeding curtesie as mine eies coulde beholde, whose
company exceeded any exquesite humaine content; and I, iust by her, full
of all whatsoeuer prouocation, forcing sollaciously loue and desire,
heaping vppe in her selfe the whole perfections of delight, and yet my
yauning and voluptuous desire, neuer the more thereby satisfied.

Well, on this sorte my burning concupiscence nothing allayed, as much as
I might, I comforted my languishing hart, vnmeasurably tormented, in
putting of it in minde, of solacious and amorous hope: and with that,
there was neuer a coale so neere put out, but it was presently renued
and set on fire, with the company of the next. And my vnbridled eyes,
the more they were vnarmed to resist her power, the more they were
inflamed with the insolent desire and liking of her wonderfull and
heauenly beautie; Still seeming more faire, more excellent, more louely,
more to be desired, extreamly apt and præpared for loue: euedently
shewing foorth in her selfe, a wonderfull increase of sweete pleasure.

Afterwards I thought with my selfe, it may be that she is some creature
which I may not desire, and it may bee the place is not fitte for such
thoughtes, and then it may bee I haue made a wise worke, and spunne a
fayre thred, if I should bee punished for my impudencie, like _Ixion_.
In like sort, the Thracian had neuer founde the deepe seate of
_Neptune_, if he had not medled with _Tethis_; and _Gallantide_, the
mayde of _Lucina_, shoulde not haue brought foorth in her mouth, if hee
had not deceiued. It may that thys Nymph is spowsed to some high and
mightie Prince, and I to offer her this dishonour, what am I worthy of?

And thus resoning with my selfe, I thought that those thinges which had
but slender assurance, woulde lightly slyppe away, and that it would not
be hard to deceiue, where was no watchfull regarde: and to bolde
spirites, Fortune was not altogether fayling: and besides, that it was
harde to knowe a mans thought. Where-vpon, euen as _Calistone_, being
ashamed at her swelling belley, shronke aside from the presence of
_Diana_; so I withdrewe my selfe, blushing at my attempt, and bridling
my inconuenient desires. Yet with a lincious eye, I neuer left to
examine, with great delight, the extreame beautie of the excellent
Nymph, disposing my selfe to her sweete loue, with an vnfallyble,
obstinate, and firme resolution.




_Polia, as yet vnknowne to her Louer Poliphilus, shee gratiously
  assureth him: who for her extreame beautie, hee indeuoreth his minde
  to loue. And both of them going to the triumphes, they see innumerable
  youths and Damosels, sporting with great delight._


The Archer _Cupid_, in my wounding heart hauing his residence, like a
Lord and king, holding me tyed in the bands of Loue, I found my selfe
pricked and grieuously tormented, in his tyrannous and yet pleasant
regiment. And abounding in doubtfull delight, vnmeasurably sighing,
I watered my plaints; and then the surmounting Nymph, with a pleasing
grace, incontinently gaue me comfort, and with her ruddy and fayre
spoken lyppes, framing violent and attractiue wordes, she gaue me
assurance: abandoning and remouing from my heart, all fearefull
thoughts, with her Olymphicall aspects, and cooling with her eloquent
speeches, my burning heart; and with an amorous and friendly regarde,
and cast of her eyes, and smiling grace, she saide thus vnto mee.

_Poliphilus_, I woulde thou shouldest vnderstand and know thys, that
true and vertuous loue hath no respect of outward things, and therefore
let not the basenes of thy apparell, diminish or lessen thy minde, if
perhaps noble and gentle, and worthy of these places, and fitte to
beholde these maruellous tryumphes; Therefore let not thy minde be
dismayed with feare, but dilligently behold what Kingdomes they
possesse, that are crowned by _Venus_. I meane, such as bee strongly
agonished and yet perseuere still, seruing and attending vpon her
amorous Aultars and sacred flames, vntill they obtaine her lawfull
fauour. And then making an ende of her short and sweet speech, both of
vs making forward, our pace neither too fast nor too slowe, but in a
measure; I thought thus, and thus discoursing with my selfe.

Oh most valiant _Perseus_, thou wouldest more feirsly haue fought with
the cruell Dragon, for the fauour of this, then for the loue of thy
fayre _Andromada_. And after.

Oh _Iason_, if the marriage of this had beene offered vnto thee, with a
more greater and more daungerous aduenture, then the obtayning of the
golden fleece, thou wouldest haue let goe that, and vndertaken this,
with a greater courage, esteeming it aboue al the iewelles and precious
treasures of the whole worlde; I, more then those of the ritch and
mightie Queene _Eleutherillida_. Continually seeming more fayre, more
beautifull, and more louely. _Hippodamia_, and all the greedy scraping
and doubtfull Vsurers, neuer tooke such delight in getting of gold.
A quyet Harbour was neuer so welcome to a destressed Marryner, in a
stormy, darke, and tempesteous winter night: nor the wished and oportune
fall of rayne, at the prayer of _Cræsus_, as the louing consent of this
daintie Nymph: more welcome to mee, then bloody broyles to warlike
_Mars_, or the first fruites of _Creta_ to _Dionisius_: or the warbling
Harpe to _Apollo_: and yet more gratefull, then fertill grounde, full
eares, and plentifull yeelding, to the labouring Husbandman.

And thus in most contented sort, passing on and pressing down the
thicke, greene, and coole grasse: sometime my searching and busie eyes,
woulde haue a cast with her pretty & small feete, passing well fitted
with shooes of Red leather, growing broader from the instept, narrowe at
the toe, and close about the heele; and sometimes her fine and moueable
legges, (her vesture of silke beeing blowne about with the winde, vppon
her virgineall partes) discouered themselues. If I might haue seene
them, I do imagine that they did looke like the finest flower of
_Peloponesus_, or like the purest milke, coagulated with Muske.

By all which most delectable thinges, tyed and bounde in the harde and
inextricable knots of vehement loue, more vneasie to vndoe then that of
_Hercules_, or that which _Alexander_ the great did cut in sunder with
hys sworde: and amorously masked in rowled nettes, and my subdued heart,
helde downe withe grieued cogitations and burning desires, leading mee
whether they would, I founde in it more pricking torments then faythfull
_Regulus_ in Aphrica. So that my sorrowing spirites exasperated with an
amorous desire and extreame vexation, continually burning in my panting
breast, coulde by no meanes bee asswaged, but with supping vp of
continuall sobbings, and breathing out of their flying losse. And thus
drowned in a mist of doubts, and seeing me vyolently taken in her loue,
I saide thus to my selfe.

O _Poliphilus_, howe canst thou leaue at any tyme thy inseperable loue,
kindled towardes thy sweete _Polia_, for any other? And therewithall,
from this Nymph, thus close and fast bounde, more strongly thẽ in the
clawes of a Creuise or Lobstar, endeuouring to vntie my selfe, I found
it no easie peece of worke, so that I coulde not choose but greeuously
binde my troubled hart, to the loue and affecting of this by all
likelihoodes, hauing the true shape, sweete resemblance, and gratious
behauiour of my most beloued _Polia_. But aboue all thinges, this came
more neere vnto mee and grieued me worst, howe I should bee assured that
shee was _Polia_. Wherevppon, from my watry eyes, the salt teares
immediatly tryckling downe, it seemed vnto me a hard & contemptuous
matter, to banish from my forlorne and poore heart, his olde soueraigne
Lady and Mistresse, and to entertaine a newe, strange, and vnknowne
Tyrannyzer.

Afterwards, I comforted my selfe again, with thinking that peraduenture
this was shee, according to the sacred Oracle and true speech, of the
mighty Queene _Eleutherillida_: and therefore, that I should not shrinke
or stoope vnder my burthen; for if I were not greatly deceiued, this was
shee indeede. And hauing made thys amorous and discoursiue thought and
swasiue præsuppose, abandoning all other desires whatsoeuer, I onely
determined with my heart and minde, to come backe againe to this noble
and excellent Nymph; in whose great loue I beeing thus taken, with
extreame compulsion, I was bolde with an vnaccustomed admyration,
dilligently to looke vpon her rare shape, and louely features, my eyes
making themselues the swallowing whirlpooles of her incomparable
beautie: and they were no sooner opened, hotly to take in the sweete
pleasure of her so benigne and conspicuous presence, but they were
strengthened for euer, to hold with them solaciously agreeing, the
assembly of all my other captiued sences, that from her and no other,
I did seeke the mittegation and quenching of my amorous flames. And in
this sort we came, whilst I was thus cruelly wounded by exasperating
Loue, somewhat vppon the right side of the spacious fielde.

In which place, were set greene trees, thicke with leaues, and full of
flowers, bearing fruite, rounde about the place and seate of such
variable and diuers sorts, neuer fading but still greene, giuing great
content to the delightfull beholder.

The gallant and pleasant Nymphe there stayed; and I also stood still:
Where looking about, by the benignitie of the fruitfull playne, with
halfe my sight, because I coulde not altogether withdrawe the same from
the amorous obiect; I behelde very neere vnto vs, a certaine shewe of an
inuyroning company, tryumphing and dauncing about vs, of most braue and
fine youthes, without beardes and vnshorne heares, but that of their
heads bushing, curling, and wrything, without any art or effæminate
crysping: crowned and dressed, with garlands and wreathes of diuers
flowers, and red Roses, with leauye Myrtle, with purple Amaranth or
flower gentle, and Melliot: and with them a great company of yonge
maydes, more fayre and delicate then bee to bee founde in Sparta; Both
kindes apparelled very richly, in silkes of changable collours, hyding
the perfect collour; some in Purple & Murry, and some in white curled
Sendall, such as Ægipt neuer affoorded, and of dyuers other collours:
some Tawney, some Crymosen, others in Greene, some in Vyolet, some in
Blewe, Peach collour, Peacocke collour, perfectly engrayned, as euer
Corica coulde yeelde: and powdered and wouen with golde, and edged and
hemmed about With orient Pearle and stones set in pure golde; some in
gownes, and others in hunting sutes.

And the most of the beautifull Nymphes, had their fayre haire smoothly
bounde vppe together, and thrise rowled about, with an excellent
finishing knot; Others had their vnstable & wauing tresses, spreading
downe ouer their fayre neckes. Some, with aboundance of haire, cast vp
ouer their forheades, and the endes turning into curles, & shaddowing
ouer the fayrenes of the same: so as Nature and not Arte, shewed her
selfe therein a beautifull mistresse; With fillets and laces of golde,
edged with orient Pearle, and others in Caules of golde, wearing about
theyr slender neckes, rich and precious Carkenets and, necklaces, of
Pearles and stone, and depending iewelles. And vppon theyr small eares,
did hange dyuers precious stones, and ouer the variable dressings of
theyr heades, before in two Hemycicles, were set shoddowes of oryent
Pearle and stone, in flowers of hayre.

All which excellent ornaments, together with theyr most elegant
personages, were easily able to alter, any churlish, vile or obstinate
heart.

Theyr fayre breastes, in a voluptuous and wanton sort, were bare to the
middest of them: And vppon their prettie feete, some wore sandalles,
after the auncient manner, beeing soles, and the foote bare fastened to
the same, with a small chaine of golde, comming vp betwixt the great toe
and the middle, and the little toe and the next, about the heele ouer
the instep, and fastening vppon the vpper part, betwixt the toes and the
instep, in a flower. Others hauing straight shooes, claspt vppon the
instep with flowers of golde. Their stockings of silke; some of Purple,
some of Carnation, some of parted collours: such as _Caius Galicola_
neuer first brought vp. Others wearing Buskins, vppon the white swelling
calfes of their legges, and laced with silke; some butned wyth golde and
precious stone.

Their fore-heades most fayre, and beautified with the moueable wauinges
of theyr crysping hayre couered ouer with a thinne vayle, lyke a Spiders
vvebbe. Theyr eyes byting and alluring, more bright, than the twinkling
starres in a cleere ayre, vnder theyr circulate brees: vvith a small
nose, betwixt their rounde and cherry cheekes: their teeth orderly
disposed, small and euen set, of the collour of refyned siluer: vppon
the rest, betwixt their sweet and soft lyppes: of the collour of
Corrall.

Many of them carrying instruments of Musique, such as neuer were seene
in _Ausonia_, nor in the handes of _Orpheus_: yeelding in the flowring
Meadowe & smoth playne, most delightfull sounds, with sweete voyces and
noyces of ioye and tryumphing: and to increase the glory, amorously
stryuing and contending one with an other, vvith solacious and pleasant
acts, accompanied with faire speeches and friendly aspects. And in this
place, with a most delectable applause, I behelde foure Tryumphes, so
precious and sumptuously set foorth, as neuer any mortall eye hath
seene.




_Poliphilus in this prescribed place, did beholde foure tryumphing
  Chariots, all set with precious stones and iewelles, by a great number
  of youthes, in the honour of Iupiter._


The first of the foure marueilous tryumphant Chariots, had foure rounde
wheeles, of Perfect greene Emeralds of Scythia; the rest of the Chariot
did amase mee to beholde, beeing made all of table Dyamonds: not of
Arabia or Cyprus, of the newe Myne, as our Lapidaries call them: but of
India, resisting the harde stroakes of yron and steele, abyding the hote
fire & striuing therwith, mollified onely with the warme bloode of
Goates, gratefull in the Magicall arte; which stones, were wonderfully
cut of a Cataglyphic explicature, and set very curiously in fine golde.

Vppon the right side of the Chariot, I sawe expressed, the
representation of a noble Nymph, with many accompanying her in a
Meddowe, crowning of victorious Bulles with garlands of flowers, and one
abyding by her very tamely.

The same Nymph, vppon the other side was also represented, who hauing
mounted vp vppon the backe of the Bull, which was gentle and white,
he carryed her ouer the sea.

Vppon the fore-ende I behelde _Cupid_, with a great number of wounded
people and Nations, marueiling to see him shoote into the ayre. And in
the hinder part, _Mars_ standing before _Iupiter_, mourning because the
boy had shotte through his impenetrable Brest-plate, and shewing the
wounde, and with the other hande, holding out his arme, he helde this
worde _Nemo_.

The fashion of this Chariot was quadrangulat, of two perfect squares,
longe wayes, of sixe foote in length and three foote in height, with a
bearing out coronice aboue and vnder the plynth: and about the same a
plaine, in breadth two foote and a halfe, and in length fiue foot and a
halfe, bearing towards the Coronice, all ouer scally, with precious
stones, with an altered congresse and order of collours, variably
disposed. And vppon the foure corners, were fastned foure coppies,
inuersed, and the mouth lying vpward vpon the proiect corner of the
Coronice, full of fruites and flowers cut of precious stones, as it were
growing out of a foliature of golde. The hornes were chased neere their
mouth, with the leaues of Poppy, and wrythen in the belly: the
gracylament & outward bending, ioyning fast to the ende of the plaine,
and breaking of in an olde fashioned iagged leaf-worke, lying a long
vnder the backe of the Coppisse, and of the same mettall. Vpon euery
corner of the Plynth, from the Coronice downeward, there was a foote
lyke a Harpies, with an excellent conuersion and turning vppon eyther
sides of the leaues of Acanthus.

The wheeles, aboue the naues and axeltrees, were closed within the
Chariot, and the sides thereof vnder the Harpies feete, bent somewhat
vpward and growing lesser, turned rounde downward, wherevnto the
furniture or trace to drawe it by, were fastned: and where the axeltree
was, there vpon the side of the bottom of the Charriot, ouer the naue of
the wheele, there came downe a prepention ioyning to the Plynth, twise
so long as deepe, of two foliatures, one extending one way and the other
an other way: and vpon the middle thereof and lowest part, was a Rose of
fiue leaues, in the seede whereof, the ende of the axeltree did lye.

Vppon the aforesaide Playne, I behelde the ymage of a fayre white and
tame Bull, trymmed and dressed with flowers, in manner like an Oxe for a
Sacrifice. And vppon his large and broade backe, did sit a princely
virgine, with long and slender armes, halfe naked; with her handes she
helde by his hornes. Her apparell was exquesite of greene silke and
golde, marueilously wouen, and of a Nymphish fashion, couering her body
and girded about her wast, edged about with Pearle and stone, and a
crowne of glittering golde vpon her fayre heade.

This Triumph, was drawne by sixe lasciuious Centaures, which came of the
fallen seede of the sausy and presumpteous _Ixion_: with a furniture of
gold vpon them, and a long their strong sides, like horses, excellently
framed and illaqueated in manner of a flagon chayne, whereby they drewe
the Tryumph; such as _Ericthonius_ neuer inuented, for swiftnesse.

Vpon euery one of them did ride a goodly Nymph, with theyr shoulders one
towards an other: three, with their beautifull faces towards the right
side of the Tryumphes, and three to the left, with Instruments of
Musique, making together a heauenly harmonie and consort. Their hayres
yellowe, and falling ouer their fayre neckes, with Pancarpiall garlands
of all manner of flowers, vpon their heades. The two next the Tryumph,
were apparelled in blewe silke, like the collour of a Peacockes necke.

The middlemost in bright Crymosen: and the two formost in an Emerald
greene, not wanting any ornamentes to sette them foorth, singing so
sweetly with little rounde mouthes, and playing vppon their instruments,
within so celestiall a manner, as woulde keepe a man from euer dying.

The Centaures were crowned with yuie, that is called _Dendrocyssos_. The
two next the tryumph did beare in their handes, two vesselles of an olde
fashion, of the Topas of Arabia, of a bright golden collour, gratefull
to _Lucina_, and to the which, the waues will be calme: slender at the
bottom, bigge swelling in the belly, and lessening small vp towardes the
Orifice; In height two foote, without eares: out of the which, did
ascend a thicke smoake or fume, of an inestimable fragrancie. The
middlemost, did sounde Trumpets of golde, with banners of silke and
golde, fastned to the Trumpets in three places.

The other two formost, with olde fashioned Cornets, agreeing in consort
with the Instruments of the Nymph.

Vnder the which triumphant Chariot, were the Axeltrees conuently placed,
wherevppon the wheeles turned, and of a balustic lyneament, waxing small
towarde the ende and rounde: Which Axeltrees, were of fine pure golde
and massiue, neuer cankering or fretting; which is the deadly poyson and
destroyer of vertue and peaceable quyet.

This tryumph was solemnly celebrated, with moderate leaping and dauncing
about, and great applause: their habites were girded with skarfes, the
endes flying abroade.

And in like sort, those which did sit vpon the Centaures, commending in
their song, the occasion and mistery of the Tryumph, in voyces consonant
and cantionell verse; more pleasant than I am able to expresse, but let
this suffice.


    _The second Tryumph._

The next Tryumph, was not lesse worthy to be beholden then the first.
The foure wheeles, the spokes, and naues, were all of Fulkish Agate, and
in dyuers places white veines: such as King _Pyrrhus_ could not shewe,
with the representation of the nine Muses, and _Apollo_ playing in the
middest of them vppon his Lute.

The Axeltrees and fashion of the same like the other: but the Tables
were of orient blewe Saphire, hauing in them, as small as motes in the
Sunne, certaine glinces of golde, gratefull to the Magicke Arte, and of
_Cupid_ beloued in the left hande.

Vpon the Table on the right side, I behelde engrauen, a goodly Matron
lying in a princely bed, beeing deliuered of two egges in a stately
Pallace: her Midwyues and other Matrons and yonge women, beeing greatly
astonished at the sight. Out of one of the which, spronge a flame of
fire: and out of the other egge two bright starres.

Vppon the other side were engrauen, the curious Parents, ignorant of
thys strange byrth, in the Temple of _Apollo_, before hys image, asking
by Oracle the cause and ende heereof, hauing this darke aunswere. _Vni
gratum Mare. Alterum gratum Mari._ And for thys ambiguous aunswere they
were reserued by their Parents.

Vppon the fore-ende of the Charyot, there was represented most liuely
the figure of _Cupid_, aloft in the skyes, with the sharpe heades of his
golden arrowes, wounding and making bleede the bodyes of dyuers foure
footed beastes, creeping Serpents, and flying Foules. And vppon the
earth, stoode dvuers persons, wondering at the force of such a little
slaue, and the effect of suche a vveake and slender Arrowe.

In the hynder ende, _Iupiter_ appoynting in hys steade, a prudent and
subtill Sheepehearde as a Iudge, awakened by hym, as hee lay sleeping
neere a most fayre Fountaine, whether of the three most fayre Goddesses,
hee esteemed best worthie. And hee beeing seduced by deuising _Cupid_,
gaue the Apple to the pleasant working _Venus_.

This tryumphant Charyot, was drawen by sixe white Elephants, coupled two
and two together, such as will hardly be found in Agesinua, nor among
the Gandars of India. _Pompei_ neuer had the like in his Tryumphes in
Affricke: neither were the like seene in the Tryumphes of the conquest
of India; their tronckes armed with deadly teeth of yuory, passing on
theyr way and drawing together, making a pleasant braying or noyse.
Their furniture & traces of pure blewe silke, twisted with threds of
golde and siluer: the fastnings in the furniture, all made vp with
square or true loue knots, lyke square eares of corne of the Mountaine
Garganus. Their Poyterelles of golde, set with Pearle and stone
different in collours; the beautie of the one striuing to excell the
beautie of the other. And thus was all their furniture or armings to the
traces, of silke as aforesayde.

Vppon them also, did ride (as before) sixe younge and tender Nymphes, in
like sort, but theyr Instruments different from the former, but agreeing
in consort: and what soeuer the first did, the same did these.

The first two were apparelled in Crymosen: the middle most two in fine
hayre collour: and the foremost in vyolet. The Caparisons of the
Eliphants were of cloth of golde, edged with great Pearles and precious
stones: And about their neckes were ornaments of great round iewelles,
and vpon their faces, great balles of Pearles, tasled with silke and
golde, vnstable and turning.

Ouer this stately Chariot tryumphant, I behelde a most white Swanne, in
the amorous imbracing of a noble Nymph, the daughter of _Theseus_, of an
incredible beautie: and vpon her lappe, sitting the same Swanne, ouer
her white thighes. She sate vppon two cushines of cloth of golde, finely
and softely wouen, with all the ornaments necessary for them.

Her selfe apparelled in a Nimphish sort, in cloth of siluer, heere and
there powdered with golde, ouer one and vnder three, without defect or
want of any thing, requisite to the adorning of so honorable a
representation, which to the beholder, may occasion a pleasurable
delight. In euery sort performed with as great applause as the first.


    _The third Tryumph._

Then followed the thyrd Tryumph, with foure wheles of Æthyopian
Chrysolite, sparkling out golde: that which hath beene helde in the
same, in olde time hath beene thought good to dryue away malignant
spirits. The wheeles vpwardly couered, as aforesaide, and the naues and
spokes of the same fashion, of greene Helitropia of Cyprus: whose vertue
is, to keepe secret in the day light, to diuine giftes, full of drops of
blood.

This Historie was engrauen vppon the right side of the Table thereof,
as followeth. _A man of great Maiestie, requesting to knowe what should
happen to his fayre daughter: her Father vnderstanding, that by her
meanes he should be dispossessed of his Crowne and dignitie; and to the
ende she shoulde not be carried away or stollen of any, he built a
mightie stronge Tower, and there, with a watchfull garde caused her to
bee kept: and shee remayning there in this sort with great content, had
falling into her virgineall lap, drops of Golde._

Vppon the other side was chased out a valiant youth, who with great
reuerence did receiue a protection of a Christall shielde, and with his
sworde afterward cutting off the heade of a terryble woman, and
afterwardes proudly bearing her heade in signe of victorie; Out of the
hotte blood of whome, did rise vp a flying horse: who striking vppon a
Mountaine with one of hys houes, made a strange springe of water to gush
out.

Vpon the fore ende I behelde the mightie _Cupid_, drawing hys golden
Arrowe, and shooting the same vp into the heauens, causing them to raine
bloode: whereat a number stoode wonderfully amazed, of all fortes of
people. Vpon the other ende, I did see _Venus_ in a wonderfull
displeasure, hauing taken her son by a Knight in a Net, and getting him
by the winges, she was about to plucke of his fethers: hauing plucked of
one handfull, that flewe about, the little elph crying out pitteously;
and an other sent from _Jupiter_, tooke him away and saued him from his
mother, and presented him to _Jupiter_: against whose diuine mouth, were
in Attic Letter these wordes written, ΣΥΜΟΙΠΛ ΥΚΥΣΤΕΚΑΙΠΚΡΟΣ and hee
couered him in the lap of his celestiall gowne.

This tryumphant Charriot, was pompously drawne with sixe fierce
Vnicornes: their heades like Harts, reuerencing the chaste _Diana_. The
poyterelles and furniture about their stronge breasts, was of golde, set
with precious stone, and fringed with siluer and hayre colloured silke,
tyed into knots, in manner of a net worke, and tasseled at euery
prependent point, their caparisons like the other before spoken of.

Vpon these did sit, six fayre virgines, in such pompe and manner as
before, apparelled in cloth of golde, wouen with blewe silke into diuers
leaues & flowers; these had a consort of liuncyers winde Instruments,
full of spirite. And vppon the toppe of the Chariot, was placed a stoole
of green Iasper, set in siluer: needfull in byrth, and medicinable for
chastitie; at the foote it was sixe square, and growing smaller towarde
the seate, and from the middle to the foote, champhered and furrowed,
and vpward wrought with nextrulles: the seate whereof was somewhat
hallowed, for the more easily sitting vppon it. The Lyneaments thereof
most excellent.

A loft vppon the same did sit a most singuler fayre Nymph, richly
apparelled in cloth of golde and blewe silke, dressed lyke a virgine,
and adorned with innumerable sortes of Pearles and stone; she shewed an
affectious delight, to beholde droppes of golde fall from heauen into
her lappe. She sate in solemne pompe like the other, and with great
applause, with her fayre and plentifull haire spreading downe ouer her
backe, crowned with a Dyademe of golde, set with sundry precious stones.


    _The fourth Tryumph._

The fourth Tryumph was borne vppon foure wheeles, with Iron strakes,
forcibly beaten out without fire; All the rest of the Charyot, in
fashion like the former, was of burning Carbuncle, shewing light in the
darkest places, of an expolite cutting: past any reason, to thinke howe
or where it was possible to be made, or by what workeman.

The right side whereof, helde this History. _An honourable woman with
childe, vnto whome Jupiter shewed himselfe (as he was wont With Iuno) in
thunder and lightning: insomuch, as shee fell all to ashes, out of the
which was taken vp a younge infant._

Vpon the other side, I behelde _Iupiter_, hauing the saide Infant in his
hands, & delyuering him to a yonge man, with winged buskyns, and a
staffe, with two serpents winding about it: who deliuered the Infant to
certaine Nymphes in a Caue, to be fostered.

In the fore-ende, I might see howe _Cupid_ hauing shot vp into heauen
with hys mischeeuous Arrowe, had caused _Iupiter_ to beholde a mortall
Nymph: and a great number of wounded people woondering at it.

In the hinder end was _Iupiter_ sitting in a tribunall seate as iudge,
and _Cupide_ appeering limping before him, and making grieuous
complaints against his louing mother, bicause that by hir means he had
wounded himselfe extreemly with the loue of a faire damsell, and that
his leg was burnt with a drop of a lampe, presenting also the yoong
Nymph and the lampe in hir hand. And _Iupiter_ with a smiling
countenance speaking to _Cupid_,

  _Perfer scintillam qui cœlum accendis & omnes._

This _Monosticon_ was grauen in Latine letters in a square table before
the faces of their supreame maiesties, the rest as is described.

This mysticall triumph was drawen by sixe spotted beasts of yealow
shining colour, and swift as the tygers of _Hyrcania_ called Leopards,
coupled togither with withes of twined vines, full of tender greene
leaues, and stalkes full of greene clusters. This chariot was drawen
very leisurely.

Vpon the middle of which plaine there was placed a base of golde by the
lowest diameter, one foote and three handfuls high, the lataster or
lowest verdge round and hollowed, in the middle vnder the vpper sime or
brimme in forme of a pallie with nextrubs, rules and cordicels: the
vpper plaine of this base was euacuated, wherein rested the traines of
the fower eagles standing vpon the plaine, smooth superficies of the
base, which were of precious Ætite of Persia, of the colour of a sakers
plume. And these stood with their shoulders one opposite against
another, and their pounces of gold fastened and sticking in the said
base, euery one surueying with their wings, and the flowering tips of
their sarcellets touching one another. Ouer these as vpon a nest, was
placed this maruellous vessell of Æthiopian Hyacints cleere and bright,
_Celso inimicus, Comiti gratiosus_. This vessell was crusted with
emeralds and vaines of diuers other pretious stones, a worke incredible.
The height thereof two foote and a halfe, the fashion in maner round,
the breadth by diameter one foote and a halfe, and the circumference
consisted of three diameters. From the heads of the eagles the bottome
or foote of the vessell did ascend vp one triens, and a border going
about the thicknes of a hand, from which border to the beginning of the
belly of the vessel, and to the bottome of the foote with this hand
breadth, was a foote and a halfe. Vpon this stood the forme of the
vessell aforesaid one handfull and a halfe broader, which halfe handfull
was distributed to the border, about the brimme of foulding leaues and
flowers standing out from the hyacinth. The diameter two quarters & a
halfe. Vnder this border there did stick out round about certaine
proportions like walnut shels, or the keele of a ship, somwhat thicke
and broade at the vpper end, and lessing themselues to nothing belowe.
From thence to the orifice it did rise vp two quarters and a halfe,
furrowed with turning champhers, and an excellent sime: and in steed of
eares to take vp the vessell by, it had two lips standing out and
turning in round like the head of a base viall.

Vnder and aboue the borders, the vessel was wrought with turned gululs,
vnduls, and imbossings, and with such lineaments were the borders
wrought, both vnder and aboue. Vppon the border in the necke of the
couer, were two halfe rings, suppressed in the border by transuersion,
one of them iust against another, which were holden in the biting teeth
of two Lysarts, or byting Dragons of greene emerauld, bearing out from
the couer. They stoode with their serpentlike feete vpon the lower part
of the couer vnder the necke, betwixt the which and the lower vessell,
was one quantitie, and from his vpper gracilament descending, he ioyned
with the turned in sime of the circumferent lymbus or verdge, where they
did closely byte togither. This couer to the necke was made in skalie
work of _Hyacinth_, except the vaynes of smaragd, for the little
dragons, their bellies and feetes fastening to the skalie couer. These
little dragons one against an other, their brests and throtes hollowing
out from the border and the couer, and their tayles turning vpwards
againe, did serue for the eares of the couer, iust ouer them of the
lower vessell.

The lower turning about, where the couer did close with the vessell
being of two parts, ioyned togither with an excellent foliature, halfe a
foote broad, as if they had bin inseparable.

The bodie of this vessell was all run ouer with a Vine, the stringes and
vaines whereof, and small curling twists, were of Topas, farre better
then is founde in the Ilande Ophiadis, the leaues of fine smaragd, and
the braunches of Amethist, to the sight most beautifull, and to the
vnderstanding woonderfull contemplable. The subiect vessell appearing
thorough the same of Hiacinth so round and polished, as any wheele can
send foorth: except, vnder the leaues there was a substaunce left,
which helde the foliature to the vessell of Hiacinth, passing ouer and
separated from the subiect. The hollowed and bending leaues with all the
other lapicidariall lineaments, were performed with such an emulation of
nature as was woonderfull.

Let vs nowe returne to the circumferent brim of the pretious vessell.
In the smooth partes whereof, vppon eyther sides of the tayles of the
Lysarts, I behelde two hystorials woorthy of regard, ingrauen in this
sort. Vpon the foreside of the vessell, the representation of _Iupiter_,
holding in his right hande a glistering sword, of the vayne of the
Æthiopian Chrysolits: and in the other hande a thunder bolt of shining
Rubie. His countenance sauour of the vaine of Gallatits, and crowned
with stars like lightening, he stoode vpon an aultar of Saphyre. Before
his fearefull maiestie, were a beuie of Nymphs, seauen in number,
apparrelled in white, proffering with their sweete voices to sing, and
after transforming themselues into greene trees like emeralds full of
azure flowers, and bowing themselues downe with deuotion to his power:
Not that they were all transformed into leaues, but the first into a
tree, hir feete to rootes, their armes and heads into braunches, some
more then other, but in a shewe that they must followe all alike, as
appeared by their heads.

Vpon the other Anaglyph, I did behold a merrie and pleasant maiesticall
personage, like a yoong fat boye, crowned with two folding serpents, one
white, and the other blacke, tied into a knot. Hee rested delightfullie
vnder a plentifull vine tree full of ripe grapes, and vpon the top of
the frame there were little naked boies, climing vp and sitting aloft
gathering the ripe clusters: others offering them in a basket to the
God, who pleasantly receiued them: other some lay fast a sleepe vpon the
ground, being drunke with the sweet iuice of the grape. Others applying
themselues to the worke of mustulent autumne: others singing and piping:
all which expression was perfected by the workman in pretious stones, of
such colour as the naturall liuelinesse of euery vaine, leafe, flower,
berrie, body, proportion, shape, and representation required. And in
this imagerie, although it was very small, yet there was no defect to be
found in the least part belonging thereunto, but perfectly to be
discerned.

Out of this former described vessell did spring vp a greene flourishing
vine, the twisting branches thereof full set with clusters of grapes,
the tawny berries of Indian Amethyst, and the leaues of greene Silenitis
of Persia: Not subiect to the change of the moone, delighted of _Cupid_.
This tree shadowed the chariot: At euery corner of this triumphant
chariot vpon the plaine where the vessell stood, was placed a
candlesticke, of excellent workmanship, vpon three feet of red corrall,
well liked of the ruder sort, resisting lightening and tempests,
fauourable and preseruatiue to the bearer: The like were not found vnder
the head of _Gorgon_ of Persia, nor in the Ocean _Erythreum_. The steale
of one of the candlesticks was of white corrall, beloued of _Diana_, of
a conuenient length, with round knobs and ioints, in height two foote.
Another was of most fine stone _Dionisias_, hauing spots growing from a
blackish to a pure red, the same pounded smelleth sweetly. The third was
of perfect _Medea_ of the colour of darke gold, and hauing the smell of
Nectar. The fourth of pretious _Nebritis_ from a blacke growing to a
white and greene. Out of the hollowed steales whereof, there ascended vp
a pyramidall flame of euerlasting fire, continually burning. The
brightnes of the works expressed through the reflexion of the lights,
and the sparkling of the pretious stones were such, as my eies dazeled
to behold them.

About which heauenly triumph, with a maruellous and solemne pompe,
infinite troups of Nymphs, their faire and plentifull tresses falling
loose ouer their shoulders, some naked with aprons of goates skins and
kids, others with tymbrels and flutes, making a most pleasaunt noise, as
in the daunce called Thiasus, in the trieterie of _Bacchus_, with green
leaffie sprigs and vine branches, instrophyated about their heads and
wasts, leaping and dauncing before the triumphs: immediately after the
triumphs followed an olde man vpon an asse, and after him was led a
goate adorned for a sacrifice: And one that followed after carrieng vpon
hir head a fanne, making an vnmeasurable laughter, and vsing furious and
outragious gestures. This was the order of these _Mimallons_, _Satirs_,
and seruants to Bacchus, bawds, _Tyades_, _Naiades_ and such as followed
after.




    _The Nymph doth shew to Poliphilus the multitude of yoong
             Louers, and their Loues, what they were,
                    and in what sort beloued_


It is verie hard for a man to accommodate his speech to apte termes,
whereby he may expreslie declare the great pompe, indesinent triumph,
vncessaunt ioie and delightful iettings aboute these rare and vnseene
chariots, and being once vndertaken, it is as vneasie to leaue off:
besides the notable companie of yoong youths, and the increasing troups
of innumerable faire and pleasant Nymphs, more sharpe witted, wise,
modest, and discreet, then is ordinarily seene in so tender yeeres, with
their beardles Louers, scarce hauing downy cheekes, pleasantly deuising
with them matters of Loue. Manie of them hauing their torches burning,
others pastophorall, some with ancient spoiles vppon the endes of
streight staues, and others with diuers sorts of Trophes vpon launces,
curiouslie hanging, caried before the mystical triumphs, with shouting
resounds aboue in the aire. Some with winde-instruments of diuers
fashions and maner of windings, sagbuts and flutes. Others with heauenly
voices singing with ineffable delights, and exceeding solace, past mans
reason to imagine: within them passed about the glorious triumphs,
turning vpon the florulent ground, and green swoord, a place dedicated
to the happie, without anie stub or tree, but the fielde was as a plaine
coequate medowe of sweete hearbes and pleasaunt flowers, of all sorts of
colours, and sundry varieng fashions, yeelding so fragrant a smell as is
possible to speake of, not burnt with the extreeme heat of the sunne,
but moderate, the ground moystened with sweete ryuers, the aire pure and
cleane, the daies all alike, the earth continually greene, the spring
neuer decaieng but renuing, the coole grasse with variable flowers like
a painting, remaining alwaies vnhurt, with their deawie freshnesse,
reseruing and holding their colours without interdict of time. There
grewe the fower sortes of Violets, Cowslops, Melilots, Rose Parsley or
Passeflower, Blew bottles, Gyth, Ladies seale, Vatrachium, Aquilegia,
Lillie conually, Amaranth, Flower gentle, Ideosmus, all sorts of sweete
pinks, and small flowring hearbs of odoriferous fragrancie and smell,
Roses of Persia, hauing the smel of muske and Amber, and innumerable
sorts of others without setting, but naturally growing in a woonderfull
distribution, peeping out from their greene leaues, and barbs very
delightfull to behold.

In this place I might see goodly braue women as the Archadian _Calisto_
the daughter of _Lycaon_, with the vnknowen _Diana_. The Lesbian
_Antiopa_ daughter to _Nycteus_, and mother to _Amphion_ and _Zeteus_
that built Thebes, with hir satyre. _Issa_ the daughter of _Machareus_
with hir shepheard. _Antichia_ the daughter of _Aecus_ and yoong
_Danaë_. _Asterie_ the daughter to _Cæus_, and _Alchmena_ with hir
fained husband. Afterward I beheld the pleasant _Ægina_ solacing hir
selfe with the cleere flood and diuine fire. The daughter of _Fullus_
and that of _Menemphus_, with hir counterfeit father, and that other of
_Diodes_ with hir lap full of flowers and a writhing serpent, and the
faire yoong gyrle no more sorrowing for the growing of hir hornes.
_Astiochia_ and _Antigone_ the daughter of _Laomedon_ solaciously
delighting hir selfe in hir storkish plumes, and _Lurisile_ the first
inuentrix of wheeles. _Garamantide_ the dauncing Nymph holding by hir
little finger, and washing hir delicate pretie feete from sweate in the
riuer Bagrada. After that I beheld a quaile flying, and a faulcon
pursuing hir: _Erigone_ hauing hir faire shining brest stickt full of
sweete grapes, and the daughter of king _Chollus_ with hir bull,
_Eriphile_ and hir changed husband: The daughter of _Alpes_ and the
virgin _Melantho_ with hir dolphin, _Phyllira_ the daughter of old
_Oceanus_ with the father of _Chiron_. Next hir _Ceres_ with hir head
instrophyated with ripe eares of corne imbracing the scalie _Hydra_: And
the faire Nymph _Lara_ sorting with _Argiphon_: and the sweete _Futurna_
of the riuer _Numicus_.

And whilest I stood with excessiue delight beholding onely as an
ignorant this rare companie and mysticall triumphes, circumsept with
these and such like sorts, and so also the delicious fields, but that me
thought it was a louely sight to behold, and so I should haue continued:
then the gratious Nymph associating and leading me, seeing my
simplicitie and carelesnes, with a ready countenance and sweete and
pleasant words, without asking, she said thus vnto me: My _Poliphilus_,
doest thou see these? (shewing me those of the olde world) these were
beloued of _Iupiter_, and this, and this was such a one, and these were
in loue with him, by this meanes shewing vnto me their high and mighty
linage, and not knowing their names, she in great curtesie told me.
Afterward she shewed me a great number of little virgins, vnder the
gouernment of three sober and discreete matrones the leaders to so great
delight: Adding thereunto very pleasantly (changing hir angellike
countenance) My _Poliphilus_, thou shalt vnderstand, that no earthly
creature can enter in heere without a burning torch as thou seest me,
either with extreeme loue and great paines, or for the fauour and
company of those three matrones. And from hir hart setting a deepe sigh,
she said: This torch haue I brought hither for thy sake, minding to put
it out in yonder temple.

These speeches pearced my hart, they were so delightfull and desired,
and so much the more, bicause she called me hir _Poliphilus_. Whereupon
I assured my selfe, that she was _Polia_, and from top to the toe I
found an extreeme alteration into a supreame delight, my hart flying
onely to hir. Which thoughts were bewraied by my countenance, and
whispering small sighes.

Which she cunningly perceiuing, brake on this new accident with these
words: Oh how many be there which would most gladly behold these
triumphes, and therefore _Poliphilus_, addresse thy thoughts to other
matters, and behold what noble and woorthy Nymphs shew themselues
deseruedly consorted with their amorous louers, curteous and affable:
who with sweete and pleasant notes in measured verse, praise and commend
one another without wearines, incessantly celebrating their turnes with
excessiue delight, and extolling the triumphs, the aire also full of the
chirpings of diuers pretie birds, yeelding a diffused charme.

About the first triumph among the reioising companie, the nine Muses did
sing, with their leader the diuine Luter _Apollo_.[A]

    [Sidenote A: This verse consisted of _Strophe_, _Aristophe_, and
    _Epodus_.]

After the triumph followed the faire Parthenopeian _Leria_, with a
lawrell crowne, accompanied with _Melanthia_, whose habites and voices
represented the pride of Greece,[A] whereupon the great Macedon rested
his head: She bare a splendent lampe, communicating the light thereof
with hir companion, then the rest more excellent both in voice and song.

    [Sidenote A: _Homer._]

There the faire Nymph shewed me the auncient _Iphianassa_, and after the
old father _Himerinus_ his daughters and their drinke, and one betwixt
the two Theban brothers: These with pleasant noises, sweete musicke and
fine agilities, paste on about the first triumph.

About the second triumph was the noble _Nemesis_ with the _Lesbian
Corina_, _Delia_ and _Neæra_, with diuers others amorous Nymphs, making
pleasaunt soundes vppon stringed instruments of yealow wood.

About the thirde triumph, the glorious Nymphs shewed me _Quintilia_ and
_Cynthea Nauta_, with others, in great solace, making sweete harmonies,
and singing pleasant verses: there also I behelde the virgin
_Violantilla_ with hir Doue, and the other sorrowing for hir Sparrow.

About the fourth triumph, before it went the _Lidian Cloe_, _Lide_,
_Neobole_, sweete _Phillis_, and the faire _Lyce_ _Tyburts_ & _Pyra_,
with their harps singing and making a most pleasant noyse. After this
fourth triumph among the Mænades and sacrificers to _Bacchus_, there
folowed an amorous damosell singing in the commendation of the head of
hir louer _Plaon_, she desired hornes. And after them all she shewed me
two women, one of them apparelled in white, and the other in greene,
which came hindermost singing togither.

And thus they marched about in a most pleasant and delightfull maner
vpon the fresh greene and flourishing plaine: Some instrophiated with
laurel, some with myrtle, and others with other sorts of flowers and
garlands, incessantly without any wearines or intermission in a
perfection of the felicitie of this world, mutually enioying one
anothers aspect and companie.




_The Nymph hauing at large declared vnto Poliphilus the mysticall
  triumphs and extreeme loue, afterwards she desired him to go on
  further, where also with great delight he beheld innumerable other
  Nymphs, with their desired louers, in a thousand sorts of pleasures
  solacing themselues vpon the greene grasse, fresh shadowes, and by
  the coole riuers and cleere fountaines. And how Poliphilus there had
  with madnes almost forgotten himselfe in the passions of desire, but
  hope did asswage his furie, quieting himselfe in the beholding of the
  sweete sauour of the faire Nymph._


Not onely happie but aboue all other most happie were he, to whom it
should be granted continually by speciall fauour to beholde the glorious
pompe, high triumphs, beautiful places, sweet scituations, togither with
the goddesses, halfe goddesses, faire Nymphes of incredible delight and
pleasure, but especially to be seconded and accompanied with so
honorable a Nymph of so rare and excellent beautie. And this I thought
not to be the least and smallest point of my felicitie. Now hauing
looked vpon these sights, I remained a great space recording of the
same, being therewith beyonde measure abundantly contented.

Afterwards, the faire and sweet damsell my guide said thus vnto me:
_Poliphilus_, let vs now go on a little further. And then immediately we
tended our walke toward the fresh fountains and shady riuers, compassing
about the flourshing fields with chrystalline currents and gratious
streames.

In which cleare water, grew the purple flowering sonne of the Nymph
_Liriope_, looking vp from his tender stringes and leaues. And al the
faire riuers were ful of other flowers sweetlie growing among their
greene and fresh leaues. This delightfull place was of a spatious and
large circuit, compassed about and inuironed with wooddie mountaines, of
a moderate height of greene lawrell, fruitefull memerels, hearie & high
pine trees, and within the cleere channels, with graueled banks, and in
some places the bottom was faire soft yealow sande, where the water ran
swifte, and the three leaued driope grew.

There were a great companie of delicate faire Nymphs of tender age, with
a redolent flower of bashfulnes, and beyond all credite beautifull, with
their beardles louers continuallie accompanied. Among which Nymphs, some
verie pleasantly with wanton countenaunces in the cleere streams shewed
themselues sportefull and gamesome, hauing taken vppe finelie their thin
garments of silke of diuers colours, and holding them in the bouts of
their white armes, the forme of their rounde thighs were seene vnder the
plytes, and their faire legges were reuealed to the naked knees, the
current streames comming vp so high: it was a sight which woulde haue
prepared one to that which were vnfit, and if himselfe had been vnable
thereunto. And there where the water was most still, turning downe their
faire faces of exceeding beautie, and bending their bodies of rare
proportion, as in a large goodly glasse they might behould their
heauenly shapes, breaking off the same with the motion of their pretie
feete, making a noyse with the contrast of the circulating water. Some
solaciouslie striuing to go by the tame swimming swans, and sportingly
casting water one at another, with the hollownes of their palms: others
standing without the water vpon the soft coole grasse, making vp of
nosegaies and garlands of sundrie sweete flowers, & giuing the same to
their louers as tokens of their fauorable remembraunce, not denieng
their sweet kisses, & louing imbracings, with the amorous regardes of
their star-like eyes.

And some were set vpon the greene banks not ouergrown with reed and
segs, but finely beautified with sweete hearbs and flowers, among the
which the tender Nymphs comming wet out of the water more cleere then
_Axius_ in _Mygdonia_, vnder the vmbragious trees, did sit sporting and
deuising one with another in delightfull imbracings, with their
reuerencing louers, not cruelly scorning & reiecting them, but with a
sociable loue and benigne affablenesse, disposing themselues to the like
shew of true affection, their sweete gestures and pleasant behauiours
far more gratious to the eie, then flowing teares be to the frowarde and
vnmercifull _Cupid_, the sweete fountaines and moist dewes to the green
fieldes, and desired forme to vnfashioned matter.

Some did sing amorous sonnets, and verses of loue, breathing out in the
same from their inflamed breasts, scalding sighs ful of sweete accents,
able to enamorate harts of stone: And to make smooth the ruggednesse of
the vnpassageable mountaine _Caucasus_, to staie whatsoeuer furie the
harpe of _Orpheus_ woulde prouoke, and the fowle and euill fauoured face
of _Medusa_, to make any horrible monster tame and tractable, and to
stop the continuall prouocation of the deuouring _Scylla_. Some rested
their heads in the chaste laps of their faire loues, recounting the
pleasaunt deuises of _Iupiter_, and they instrophyating their curled
locks with sweete smelling flowers.

Others of them fained that they were forsaken, and seemed to flie and go
awaie from them, whom dearely they did affect, and then was there
running one after another with loud laughters, and effeminate criengs
out, their faire tresses spredding downe ouer their snowie shoulders
like threeds of gold, bound in laces of greene silke: Some loose after a
Nymphish maner, others bounde vp in attyres of golde set with pearle.
Afterwards comming neere togither, they would stowpe downe, and twiching
vp the sweete flowers with their faire and tender fingers, fling the
same in the faces of their pursuing louers with great pleasure and
solace, maintaining their fained disgracings.

Others with great curtesie were putting of Rose leaues one after another
into their laced brests, adding after them sweete kisses, some giuing
their louers (if ouer-bold) vpon the cheekes with their harmles palmes
pretie ticks, making them red like the wheeles of _Phœbus_ in a faire
and cleere morning: with other new and vnthought contentions, such as
loue could deuise. They all being pleasant, merrie, and disposed to
delight: Their gestures and motions girlish, and of a virgineall
simplicitie, putting on sincere loue without the offence of honorable
vertue: Free and exempt from the occursion of griefe or emulation of
aduers fortune: Sitting vnder the shade of the weeping sister of the
whited _Phaeton_, and of the immortall _Daphne_ and hairie pineapple
with small and sharpe leaues, streight Cyprus, greene Orenge trees, and
tall Cedars, and others most excellent, abounding with greene leaues,
sweete flowers, and pleasant fruits still flourishing in such sort as is
inestimable, euenly disposed vpon the gratious banks, & orderly growing
in a moderat distance vpon thee grassie ground, inuested with green
Vinca peruince or laurel. What hart is so cold and chilling, that would
not be stirred vp to heate, manifestly beholding the delightfull duties
of reciprocall loue, such as I was perswaded would haue kindled _Diana_
hir selfe?

Whereupon I was bold to shew that folly which tormented my inward
spirits, enuying to see what others possessed, that was a continuall
delight in pleasure and solace without any wearines in full cloying, and
thus diuers times my hart being set on fire by my eies, and extreemely
burning, my minde still fixed vpon delightfull pleasures and their
smacking kisses, and regarding with a curious eie the abounding guerdons
of the fethered god, me thought at that instant, that I did behold the
extreeme perfection of pleasure. And by this meanes I stood wauering and
out of measure amazed, and as one which had droonke an amorous potion,
calling into remembrance the ointments of the mischeeuous _Circes_, the
forcible hearbs of _Medea_, the hurtfull songs of _Byrrena_, and the
deadly verses of _Pamphile_, I stood doubtfull that my eies had seene
somthing more than humane, and that a base, dishonorable, and frail
bodie should not be where immortall creatures did abide.

After that I was brought from these long and doubtfull thoughts and
phantasticall imaginations, and remembring all those maruellous diuine
shapes and bodies which I had personally seene with mine eies, I then
knew that they were not deceitfull shadowes, nor magicall illusions, but
that I had not rightly conceiued of them.

And now with earnest consideration among these beholding the most
excellent Nymph fast by me, my eies filled with amorous darts ceased not
to wound my passionate hart, by means wherof incontinently all my
wandering thoughts were stirred vp, compact, and fixed vpon hir their
desired obiect, recalling my mortified soule afresh to be tormented in
his first flames, which most cruelly I suffered, in that I durst not be
bold to aske if she were my desired _Polia_, for she had put me in some
doubt thereof before, and now fearing to offend hir with my being ouer
bolde, and ore troublesome with my rude and vntilled toong, diuers times
when my voice was breaking out betwixt my lips, vpon that occasion I
suppressed the same. But what she should be, it was beyond my compasse
to imagine, and I stood as suspicious thereof, as the deceiued _Socia_
with the fained _Atlantiades_. Thus with diligent regards and cordiall
searches examining hir heauenly features inuaded with a burning desire
beyond measure, I said to my self: Oh that I might be, if it were
possible, a free mã in such a place, for no sorrow shoulde greeue me,
nor imminent danger should make me afraid: although that frowarde
fortune shoulde oppose hir selfe against me, I woulde spende my life
without any regard therof, not refusing to vndertake the laborsome and
great enterprise of the two gates shewed to the sonne of _Amphitrio_.

To spend the prime of my youth and pleasure of my yeers in the mortall
daungers of the merciles seas, and in the fearfull places of
_Trinacria_, with the excessiue trauels and terrors of _Ulysses_, in the
darke caue of the horrible _Polyphem_, the son of _Neptune_, to be
transformed in the companie of _Calypso_, although I lost my life, or
indured the most hard & long seruitude of _Androdus_, for all wearines
is forgotten where loue is vehement. To vndertake with the amorous
_Minalion_ and _Ileus_ to runne with _Atalanta_, or to com but in such
sort as the strong and mightie _Hercules_ for his loue _Deianira_, did
with the huge _Achelous_, so as I might atchieue so gratious a fauor,
and attaine to so high delight, as the remaining in these solacious
places, and aboue all to enioy the precious loue and inestimable good
wil of hir, more faire without comparison, then _Cassiopeia_, of better
fauour then _Castiamira_. Ah me, my life and death is in hir power! And
if so be that I seeme vnwoorthie of hir fellowshippe and amorous
commers, yet would God it might be granted me as a speciall rewarde and
priuiledge to looke vpon hir: and then I saide to my selfe, oh
_Poliphilus_, if these heauie and burthenous weights of amarous conceits
do oppresse thee; the sweetenes of the fruite doth allure thee
thereunto: and if the peremptorie dangers strike thee into a terror, the
hope of the supportation and helpe of so faire a Nymph will animate thee
to be resolute. Thus my thought being diuers, I said, Oh God, if this be
that desired _Polia_ which I see at this present, and whose precious
impression without intermission, I haue stil born in my burning and
wounded hart, fro the first yeers of my loue vntil this present, I am
contented with all sorrows, & besides hir, I desire no other request but
only this, that she may be drawne to my feruent loue, that it may be
with vs alike, or that I may be at liberty, for I am no longer able to
dissemble my griefe, or hide the extremity of my smart, I die liuing, &
liuing am as dead: I delight in that which is my griefe: I go mourning:
I consume my self in the flame, & yet the flame doth norish me, &
burning like gold in the strong cement, yet I find my self like cold
yce. Ah wo is me, that loue should be more greeuous vnto me then the
weight of _Iuarime_ to _Typhon_. It disperseth me more, then the
rauenous vulturs the glomerated bowels of _Tityus_: It holdeth me in
more, then the labirinth crooking: It tosseth me more, then the
northeast winds the calme seas: It teareth me woorse then _Acteons_
dogges their flieng master: It troubleth my spirits more then horrible
death doth them who desire to liue: It is more direfull to my vexed
hart, then the crocodils bowels to _Ichneumon_. And so much the more is
my greefe, that with all the wit I haue, I knowe not to thinke in what
part of the worlde I shoulde be, but streight before the sweete fire of
this halfe goddesse, which without any corporall substance consumeth me:
hir aboundant and faire yealow haire, a snare and net for my hart to be
masked in: hir large and phlegmatique forehead, like white lillies, bynd
me in as with a withe: hir pearcing regards take away my life as sweete
prouocations to afflict me: hir roseall cheekes do exasperate my desire,
hir ruddie lips continue the same, and hir delicious breasts like the
winter snow vpon the hyperboreall mountaines, are the sharp spurs and
byting whip to my amorous passions: hir louely gestures and pleasant
countenance do draw my desire to an imaginatiue delight, heaping vp my
sorrow. And to all these insulting martyrdoms and greeuous vexations of
that impious and deceitfull _Cupid_ I laie open, mightilie striuing to
beare them, and no waie able to resist them, but to suffer my selfe to
be ouercome: neither coulde I shun the same, but remained still as one
vnawares lost in the Babylonian fen.

Oh _Titius_, thou canst not perswade me that thy paine is equall with
mine, although that the vultures teare open thy breast, and taking out
thy smoking warm hart, do pluck it in peeces with their crooked beaks,
and pinch the same in their sharpe tallents, eating vp also the rest of
thy flesh, vntill they haue ingorged thẽselues, & within a while after
thou renewed againe, they begin afresh to pray vpon thee. Thou hast a
time to be reuiued againe, and made sound as euer thou wert: but two
eies without all pitie or intermission haue wounded me, deuour and
consume me, leauing me no time of rest, or space to be comforted.

And hauing had these discourses with my selfe, I began secretly to
mourne and weepe, and desire a way that I might die, fetching deepe
sighes as if my hart had torne in sunder with euery one of them. And
diuers times I had purposed with a lamentable voice to desire hir helpe,
for that I was at the point of death: but as one drowned and
ouerwhelmed, I deemed that way to be vaine, and to no purpose, and
therfore furiously, and as one of a raging spirit I thought thus: Why
doest thou doubt, _Poliphilus_? Death for loue is laudable, and
therefore my greeuous and malignant fortune, my sorrowful accident and
hard hap in the loue of so beautifuil a Nymph, will be writ and reported
when I shall lie interred. The same will be sung in doleful tunes vpon
sweete instruments of musicke, manifesting the force of hurtfull loue.

And thus continuing the follie of my thoughts, I said: It may be that
this Nymph, by al likelihoods, is some reuerend goddesse, and therefore
my speeches will be but as the crackling reedes of Archadia in the moist
and fennie sides of the riuer Labdone, shaken with the sharpe east wind,
with the boisterous north, cloudy south & rainie south west wind.
Besides this, the gods will be seuere reuengers of such an insolencie,
for the companions of _Vlysses_ had been preserued from drowning and
shipwracke, if they had not stolne _Apollos_ cattell kept by _Phaetusa_
and hir sister _Lampetia_. _Orion_ had not beene slaine by a scorpion,
if he had not attempted the cold & chast _Diana_, and therefore if I
should vse any indecencie against the honor of this Nymph in any sort,
such like reuenge or woorse woulde be vsed vpon me. At last getting
foorth of these changeable thoughts, I did greatly comfort my selfe in
beholding and contemplating the excellent proportion and sweete sauour
of this ingenuous and most rare Nymph, containing in hir al whatsoeuer
that may prouoke amorous conceits and sweete loue, giuing from hir faire
eies so gratious and fauorable regards, as thereby I somewhat tempered
my troublesome and vnbrideled thoughts. And my resounding sighes
reflexed with a flattering hope (oh the amorous foode of louers and
sauce of salt teares) by these and no other rains I did manage my
vehement thoughts, and made them stop in a conceiued hope, fixing mine
eies with excessiue delight vpon hir faire bodie and well disposed
members, by all which, my discontented desires were gently mitigated and
redeemed from that furie and amorous fire, which so neere had bred the
extremitie of my passions.




_The Nymph leadeth the inamored Poliphilus to other pleasant places,
  where he beheld innumerable Nymphs solacing them, and also the triumph
  of Vertumnus and Pomona._


By no meanes I was able to resist the violent force of _Cupids_
artillerie, and therefore the elegant Nymph hauing amorously gotten an
irrevocable dominion ouer me a miserable louer, I was inforced to follow
still after hir moderate steps, which led me into a spatious and large
plaine, the conterminate bound of the flowered greene & sweet smelling
vallie, where also ended the adorned mountaines and fruitfull hils,
shutting vp the entrance into this golden countrie, full of incredible
delight with their ioining togither: couered ouer with green trees of a
cõspicuous thicknes & distance, as if they had been set by hand, as Yew
trees, wild Pynes, vnfruitfull but dropping Resin, tall pineapple,
straight Firre, burning Pitch trees, the spungie Larix[A], the aierie
Teda[B] beloued of the mountains, celebrated and preserued for the
festiuall Oreades[C]. There both of vs walked in the greene and
flowering plaine, shee being my guide through the high cypres trees, the
broad leaued beech, coole shadie okes full of maste, and other
hornebeames, pricking iuniper, weake hasell, spalt ash, greene lawrell,
and humbryferous esculies, knottie plane trees & lyndens[D] moouing by
the sweet breath of the pleasant Zephirus, whistling through their
tender branches, with a benigne and fauorable impulsion.

    [Sidenote A: _Larix_, is a tree hauing leaues like a pine, & good
    for building, it will neither rot, woormeate, nor burne to coales.]

    [Sidenote B: _Teda_, is a tree out of the which issueth a liquor
    more thinne than pitch.]

    [Sidenote C: _Oreades_, be countrie Nymphs.]

    [Sidenote D: _Lyndens_ or teile trees, in Latin _Tiliæ_, they beare
    a fruit as big as a bean, hauing within seedes like anyse seeds.]

All which greene trees were not thickly twisted togither, but of a
conuenient distaunce one from another, and all of them so aptly
distributed as to the eie the sight thereof bred great delight.

This place was frequented with countrie Nymphs and _Dryades_[A], their
small and slender wastes being girded with a brayding of tender corules
of sprigs, leaues, and flowers and vpon their heads their rising vp
haires, were compassed about as with garlands. Amongst them were the
horned faunes, and lasciuious satyres, solemnising their faunall feasts,
being assembled togither out of diuers places, within this fertile &
pleasant cuntrie: bearing in their hands so tender green and strãge
boughs, as are not to be foũd in the wood of the goddes _Feronia_,[B]
when the inhabitants carrie hir image to the fire.

    [Sidenote A: _Dryades_, be Nymphs of the woods.]

    [Sidenote B: _Feronia_ a goddesse of the woods.]

From thence we entered into a large square inclosure cõpassed about with
broade walkes, straight from one corner to another, with a quick-set
vpon either sides, in height one pace, of pricking iuniper thicke set
togither, and mixt with box, compassing about the square greene mead.
In the rowes of which quick-set there were symmetrially planted the
victorious palme trees, whose branches were laden with fruite, appearing
out of their husks, some blacke, some crymosen, and many yealow, the
like are not to be found in the land of Ægypt, nor in Dabulam[A] among
the Arabian Scænits,[B] or in Hieraconta beyond the Sauromatans.[C] All
which were intermedled with greene Cytrons, Orenges, Hippomelides,
Pistack trees, Pomegranats, Meligotõs, Dendromirts, Mespils, and Sorbis,
with diuers other fruitfull trees.

    [Sidenote A: _Dabulam_, a fertile place in Arabia.]

    [Sidenote B: _Scænits_, be a people in Arabia, that dwell altogither
    in tents.]

    [Sidenote C: _Sauromatans_, be people of Sarmatia, which is a large
    cuntry, reaching frõ Germany & the riuer Vistula to Hycænia, and is
    deuided into two parts Europea and Asiatica.]

In this place vppon the greene swoord of the flowering mead, and vnder
the fresh and coole shadowes, I might behold a great assemblie met
togither of strange people, & such as I had neuer before seene, full of
ioyes and pastimes, but basely apparrelled, some in fauns skins, painted
with white spots, some in lynx[A] skins, others in leopards: and manie
had fastened togither diuers broad leaues, instrophiating them with
sundrie flowers, therewithall couering their nakednes, singing, leaping,
and dauncing with great applause.

    [Sidenote A: _Lynx_ is a beast spotted, but in shape like a wolph,
    being quicke of sight.]

These were the Nymphs Hamadryades,[A] pleasantly compassing vppon either
sides the flowered _Vertumnus_,[B] hauing vppon his heade a garlande of
roses, and his gowne lap full of faire flowers, louing the station of
the woollie ramme. He sate in an ancient fashioned carre, drawne by
fower horned fauns or satyrs, with his louing and faire wife _Pomona_,
crowned with delicate fruits, hir haire hanging downe ouer hir
shoulders, of a flaxen colour, and thus she sate participating of hir
husbands pleasure and quiet, and at hir feete laie a vessell called
Clepsydra[C]. In hir right hand she held a copie full of flowers,
fruits, and greene leaues, and in hir left hande a branch of flowers,
fruits and leaues.

    [Sidenote A: _Hamadryades_ were nymphs of the wood and _Symenides_]

    [Sidenote B: _Vertumnus_ the God of fruits.]

    [Sidenote C: _Clepsydra_ is sometime taken for a diall measuring
    time by the running of water, but here for a pot to water a garden
    and yoong sectlings in a nourcery for an orchyard.]

Before the carre and the fower drawing satyrs, there marched two faire
Nymphs, the one of them bare a trophæ with a præpendant table, whereupon
was written this title,

  _Integerrimam corporis valetudinem & stabile robur castasque
    mensarum delitias, & beatam animi securitatem cultoribus
    me offero._

And the other bare a trophæ of certaine greene sprigges bound togither,
and among them diuers rurall instruments fastened. These passed on thus
after the ancient maner, with great ceremonies, and much solemnitie,
compassing about a great square stone like an aulter, standing in the
middest of this faire mead, sufficiently moystened with current streames
from beautifull fountaines.

This square stone or aulter was of pure white marble, curiouslie cut by
a cunning lapicidarie, vpon euery front wherof was a woonderfull goodly
expression, of an elegant image, so exact, as the like else-where is
hardly to be found.

The first was a faire goddesse, hir treces flieng abroad, girded with
roses and other flowers, vpon a thin vpper garment couering hir
beautifull and pleasant proportion. She helde hir right hand ouer an
ancient vessell, in maner of a chafing-dish, called Chytropodus, sending
foorth a flame of fire, into the which shee did cast roses and flowers,
and in the other hand she held a branch of sweete myrtle, full of
berries. By hir side stoode a little winged boy smiling, with his bowe
and arrowes. Ouer hir head were two pigeons. And vnder the foote of this
figure was written

    _Florido veri S._

Vpon the other side I beheld in an excellent caruing, the representation
of a damosell of a maidenly countenaunce, whose stately maiestie gaue
great commendation to the curious deuise of the workeman. She was
crowned with a garland of wheat eares, hir haire flingering abroade, and
hir habyte Nymphish. In hir right hand she held a copie full of rype
graine, and in the other hand three eares of corne, vpon their strawie
stalks. At hir feete lay a wheat sheaue bound vp, and a little boy with
gleanings of corne in either hands. The subscription was this.

    _Flauæ Messi S._

Vpon the third side was the likenes in a deuine aspect naked of a yoong
boy, crowned with vine leaues, and of a wanton countenance, holding in
his left hand certaine clusters of ripe grapes, and in the other, a
copie full of grapes which did hang ouer the mouth thereof. At his feete
laie a hayrie goate and this writing vnder.

    _Mustulento Autumno S._

The last square did beare vpon it a kingly image passing well cut, his
countenance displeasant and austere, in his left hand he held a scepter
vp into the heauens, the aire cloudie, troublesome and stormie, and with
the other hand reaching into the clouds full of haile. Behinde him also
the aire was rainie and tempestuous. He was couered with beasts skins,
and vpon his feete he ware sandals, where vnder was written,

    _Hiemi Æoliæ S._

From thence the most faire and pleasant Nymph brought me towards the sea
side and sandie shore, where we came to an olde decaied temple, before
the which vpon the fresh and coole hearbs, vnder sweete shadie trees we
sate downe and rested ourselues, my eies very narrowly beholding, with
an vnsatiable desire, in one sole perfection and virgineall bodie, the
accumulation and assembly of all beauties; an obiect interdicting my
eies to behold any gracious, that except, or of so great content.

Where refreshing in a secret ioy with new budding conceits my burning
hart, and leauing off vulgar and common follies, I began to consider of
the intelligible effect of honest loue, and withall of the cleerenes of
the skies, the sweete and milde aire, the delightfull site, the pleasant
countrie, the green grasse decked with diuersity of flowers, the faire
hils adorned with thicke woods, the quiet time, fresh windes, and
fruitfull place, beautifully enriched with diffluent streames, sliding
downe the moist vallies betwixt the crooked hils in their grauelled
channels, and into the next seas with a continued course softly vnlading
themselues.

A ground most healthfull, the grasse coole and sweet: and from the trees
resounded the sweete consents of small chirping birds. The flouds and
fields of Thessalie[A] must giue place to this.

    [Sidenote A: _Thessalie_ is a region of Greece, hauing vpon the
    one side Macedonia, and on the other Bœotia, reaching betweene
    Thermopylæ, and the riuer Pineus, euen to the sea side, it is the
    gardẽ of Grecia.]

And there sitting thus togither among the sweete flowers and redolent
roses, I fastened mine eies vpon this heauenly shape of so faire and
rare a proportion, whereunto my sences were so applied, drawen and
addicted, that my hart was ouerwhelmed with extreeme delights, so as I
remained senceles, and yet cast into a curious desire to vnderstand and
knowe what should be the reason and cause that the purple humiditie in
the touch of hir bodie, in the smoothnes of hir hand should be as white
as pure milke: and by what meanes that nature had bestowed in hir faire
bodie the fragrant sweetnes of Arabia. And by what industrie in hir
starrie forehead pampynulated with threds of gold aptly disposed, she
had infixed the fairest part of the heauens, or the splendycant
Heraclea[A].

    [Sidenote A: _Heraclea_, is the name of diuers faire cities, one in
    the confines of Europe, another in Italie & in Pontus by the riuer
    Licus, also in Narbon by Rodanus, also in Caria, Crete & Lydia,
    whereof the Lodestone taketh his name.]

Afterward letting fall mine eies towards hir prety feete, I beheld them
inclosed in red leather cut vpon white, fastened vpon the instep with
buttons of gold in loopes of blew silke. And from thence I returned
vpward my wanton regard to hir straight necke compassed about with a
carkenet of orient pearle, striuing but not able to match with the
whitenes of the sweet skin. From thence descending down to hir shining
breast and delitious bosome, from whence grew two round apples, such as
_Hercules_ neuer stole out of the garden of _Hesperides_[A]. Neither did
euer _Pomona_ behold the like to these two standing vnmooueable in hir
roseall breast, more white than hils of snowe in the going downe of the
sunne. Betwixt the which there passed downe a delicious vallie, wherein
was the delicate sepulcher of my wounded hart exceeding the famous
_Mausolea_[B].

    [Sidenote A: _Hesperides_, were the 3. daughters of Atlas, Ægle,
    Aretusa and Hesperetusa, who had an orchard of goldẽ apples, kept by
    a dragon whõ Hercules slew & tooke away the apples.]

    [Sidenote B: A sepulcher built by Artemisia in the honor of hir
    husbande Mausolus king of Cania.]

I then being content with a wounded hart full well vnderstanding that
mine eies had drawen it dying into all these elegant parts. Yet
neuertheles I could not so bridle and suppresse my amorous inflamed
sighes, or so closely couer them, but that they would needs expresse my
inward desire.

By means whereof she was changed from contagious loue, and striking with
hir stolen regards (enuying the same) she turned it vpon me, so as I
perceiued an incensing fire pruriently diffusing it selfe through my
inward parts and hollow veines: and during the contemplate beholding of
hir most rare and excellent beautie, a mellifluous delight and sweete
solace constrained me thereunto. Thus disordinately beaten with the
importune spur of vnsatiable desire, I found my selfe to be set vpon
with the mother of loue, inuironed round about with hir flamigerous
sonne, and inuaded with so faire a shape, that I was with these and
others so excellent circumstances brought into such an agonie of minde
and sicknes of bodie, and in such sort infeebled, that the least haire
of hir head was a band forcible ynough to hold me fast, and euery rowled
tramell a chaine and shackle to fetter me, being fed with the sweetnes
of hir beautie, and hooked with the pleasant baits of hir amorous
delights, that I was not able with whatsoeuer cunning deuise to resist
the inuading heates and prouoking desires still comming vpon me, that I
determined rather to die than longer to endure the same, or in this
solitarie place to offer hir any dishonor.

Then againe I was determined with humble requests and submissiue
intreaties to say thus:

Alas most delighted _Polia_, at this present to die by thee is a thing
that I desire, and my death if it were effected by these thy small,
slender and faire hands, the ende thereof should be more tolerable,
sweete and glorious vnto me, bicause my hart is compassed about with
such tormenting flames, still more and more cruelly increasing, and
burning the same without pitie or intermission, so as by meanes thereof
I am bereft of all rest.

And heerewithall intending to put in execution another determinate
purpose, behold my hart was tormented with more sharpe flames, that me
thought I was all of a light fire. Ah wo is me what wert thou aduised to
do _Poliphilus_? Remember the violence done to _Deianira_ and the chaste
Roman lady. Consider what followed them for a reward, and diuers others.

Call to minde that mighty princes haue beene reiected of their
inferiors, how much more then a base and abiect person, but tract of
time giueth place to them which expect the bountie thereof. Time causeth
the fierce lions to be tame, and whatsoeuer furious beast: the small ant
by long trauell laieth vp hir winter foode in the hard tree, and shall
not a diuine shape lying hid in a humane bodie take the impression of
feruent loue, and then holding the same, shake off all annoyous and
vexing passions, hoping to enioy amorous fruits, desired effects, and
triumphing agonismes.

The Nymph _Polia_ perceiuing well the change of my colour and blood
comming in more stranger sort than _Tripolion_ or _Teucrion_, thrise a
day changing the colour of his flowers, and my indeuoring to sende out
scalding sighes deeply set from the bottome of my hart, she did temper
and mitigate the same with hir sweete and friendly regards, pacifieng
the rage of my oppressing passions, so as notwithstanding my burning
minde in these continuall flames and sharpe prouocations of loue, I was
aduised patiently to hope euen with the bird of Arabia in hir sweet nest
of small sprigs, kindled by the heate of the sunne to be renewed.

Errors and anomalies noted by transcriber:

This e-text is based on a facsimile edition made from a single copy of
the 1592 original. In some places, text is illegible or missing.

“The Italian version” refers to the 1499 text. At time of preparation,
page images of this book were available at
  http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/HP/hyp000.htm
and linked pages. Note that the 1592 English translation covers just
under half the Italian text. The Italian was consulted in some cases
of uncertain readings in the English. The sidenotes have no Italian
equivalent.

Oddities of punctuation are as in the original, but missing full stops
at paragraph-end have been supplied.

The text often prints æ in place of œ, especially when italicized:
  Phæbus; Cræsus (twice); Cæus
The spellings _Pasiphæ_ (for Pasiphae or Pasiphaë) and _Androdus_
(for Androclus or Androcles) were also left unchanged.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
