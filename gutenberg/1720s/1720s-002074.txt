CHAPTER I.

     Preface to the Epistle.

ALL happiness to you my sons
and daughters, in the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
loved us, in peace.

2  Having perceived abundance
of knowledge of the great and
excellent laws of God to be in you,
I exceedingly rejoice in your blessed
and admirable souls, because ye
have so worthily received the
grace which was grafted in you.

3  For which cause I am full of
joy, hoping the rather to be saved;
inasmuch as I truly see a spirit
infused into you, from the pure
fountain of God:

4  Having this persuasion, and
being fully convinced thereof,
because that since I have begun to
speak unto you, I have had a more
than ordinary good success in the
way of the law of the Lord, which
is in Christ,

5  For which cause brethren, I
also think verily that I love you
above my own soul; because that
therein dwelleth the greatness of
faith and charity, as also the hope
of that life which is to come.

6  Wherefore considering this,
that if I shall take care to
communicate to you a part of what
I have received, it shall turn to
my reward, that I have served such
good souls. I gave diligence to
write in a few words unto you;
that together with your faith, your
knowledge also may be perfect.

7  There are therefore three
things ordained by the Lord; the
hope of life, the beginning, and
the completion of it.

8  For the Lord hath both
declared unto us, by the prophets,
those things that are past; and
opened to us the beginnings of
those that are to come.

9  Wherefore, it will behove us,
as he has spoken, to come more
holily, and nearer to his altar.

10  I therefore, not as a teacher
but as one of you, will endeavour
to lay before you a few things by
which you may, on many accounts,
become the more joyful.



CHAPTER II.

     That Clod has abolished the legal sacrifices,
     to introduce the spiritual righteousness of the Gospel.

SEEING then the days are
exceedingly evil, and the
adversary has got the power of this
present world we ought to give the
more diligence to inquire into the
righteous judgments of the Lord.

2  Now the assistants of our
faith are fear and patience; our
fellow-combatants, long suffering
and continence.

3  Whilst these remain pure
in what relates unto the Lord,
wisdom, and understanding, and
science, and knowledge, rejoice
together with them.

4  For God has manifested to us
by all the prophets, that he has no
occasion for our sacrifices, or
burnt-offerings, or oblations:
saying thus;  To what purpose is
the multitude of your sacrifices
unto me, saith the Lord.

5  I am full of the burnt-offerings
of rams, and the fat of fed beasts;
and I delight not in the blood of
bullocks, or of he-goats.

6  When ye come to appear
before me, who hath required
this at your hands? Ye shall no
more tread my courts.

7  Bring no more vain oblations,
incense is an abomination unto me
your new moons and sabbaths,
and the calling of assemblies
I cannot bear with, it is iniquity,
even the solemn meeting; your
new moons and your appointed
feasts my soul hateth.

8  These things therefore hath
God abolished, that the new law
of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
is without the yoke of any such
necessity, might have the spiritual
offering of, men themselves.

9  For so the Lord saith again
to those heretofore; Did I at all
command your fathers when they
came out of the land of Egypt
concerning burnt-offerings of
sacrifices?

10  But this I commanded them,
saying, Let none of you imagine
evil in your hearts against his
neighbour, and love no false oath.

11  Forasmuch then as we are
not without understanding, we
ought to apprehend the design of
our merciful Father. For he
speaks to us, being willing that
we who have been in the same
error about the sacrifices, should
seek and find how to approach
unto him.

12  And therefore he thus
bespeaks us, The sacrifice of God
(is a broken spirit,) a broken and
contrite heart--God will not despise.

13  Wherefore brethren, we ought
the more diligently to inquire
after those things that belong
to our salvation, that the
adversary may not have any
entrance into us, and deprive
us of our spiritual life.

14  Wherefore he again speaketh
to them, concerning these things;
Ye shall not fast as ye do this day,
to make your voice to be heard on high.

15  Is it such a fast that I have
chosen? A day for a man to afflict
his soul? Is it to bow down his
head like a bulrush, and to spread
sackcloth and ashes under him?
Wilt thou call this a fast, and an
acceptable day to the Lord?

16  But to us he saith on this
wise: Is not this the fast that I
have chosen, to loose the bands of
wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens,
and to let the oppressed go free:
and that ye break every yoke?

17  Is it not to deal thy bread
to the hungry, and that thou bring
the poor that are cast out to thy
house? When thou seest the naked
that thou cover him, and that thou
hide not thyself from thy own
flesh.

18  Then shall thy light break
forth as the morning, and thy
health shall spring forth speedily;
and thy righteousness shall go
before thee; the glory of the Lord
shall be thy reward.

19  Then shalt thou call and
the Lord shall answer; thou shalt
cry and he shall say, Here I am;
if thou put away from the midst of
thee the yoke; the putting forth
of the finger, and speaking vanity;
and if thou draw out thy soul to
the hungry; and satisfy the
afflicted soul.

20  In this, therefore, brethren,
God has manifested his foreknowledge
and love for us; because the
people which he has purchased to
his beloved Son were to believe
in sincerity; and therefore he has
shown these things to all of us,
that we should not run as
proselytes to the Jewish Law.



CHAPTER III.

     The prophecies of Daniel concerning the ten kings,
     and the coming of Christ.

WHEREFORE it is necessary
that searching diligently into
those things which are soon to
come to pass, we should write to
you what may serve to keep you
whole.

2  To which end, let us flee from
every evil work and hate the errors
of the present time, that we may
be happy in that which is to come.

3  Let us not give ourselves the
liberty of disputing with the wicked
and sinners; lest we should chance
in time to become like unto them.

4  For the consummation of sin
is come, as it is written, as the
prophet Daniel says. And for this
end the Lord hath shortened the
times and the days, that his
beloved might hasten his corning
to his inheritance.

5  For so the prophet speaks;
There shall ten kings reign in
the heart, and there shall rise last
of all another little one, and he
shall humble three kings.

6  And again Daniel speaks in
like manner concerning the kingdoms;
and I saw the fourth beast dreadful
and terrible, and strong exceedingly;
and it had ten horns. I considered
the horns, and behold there came up
among them another little horn,
before which were three of the first
horns plucked up by the roots.

7  We ought therefore to understand
this also: And I beseech you, as one
of your own brethren, loving you all
beyond my own life, that you look
well to yourselves, and be not like
to those who add sin to sin, and say;
That their covenant is ours also.
Nay, but it is ours only: for they
have forever lost that which Moses
received.

8  For thus saith the Scripture
And Moses continued fasting forty
days and forty nights in the Mount;
and he received the covenant from
the Lord, even the two tables of
stone, written by the hand of God.

9  But having turned themselves
to idols they lost it; as the Lord
also said to Moses; Moses, go
down quickly, for thy people which
thou hast brought forth out of
Egypt, have corrupted themselves,
and turned aside from the way
which I commanded them. And
Moses cast the two tables out of
his hands; and their covenant was
broken; that the love of Jesus
might be sealed in your hearts,
unto the hope of his faith.

10  Wherefore let us give heed
unto the last times. For all the
time past of our life and our faith,
will profit us nothing; unless we
continue to hate what is evil, and
to withstand the future temptations.
So the Son of God tells us; Let us
resist all iniquity and hate it.

11  Wherefore consider the works
of the evil way. Do not withdraw
yourselves from others as if you
were already justified; but coming
altogether into one place, inquire
what is agreeable to and profitable
for the beloved of God.  For the
Scripture saith; Woe unto them
that are wise in their own eyes;
and prudent in their sight.

12  Let us become spiritually a
perfect temple to God. As much
as in us lies let us meditate upon
the fear of God; and strive to the
utmost of our power to keep his
commandments; that we may rejoice
in his righteous judgments.

13  For God will judge the world
without respect of persons and
everyone shall receive according
to his works.

14  If a man shall be good, his
righteousness shall go before him
if wicked, the reward of his
wickedness shall follow him.

15  Take heed therefore lest
sitting still now, that when we are
called, we fall asleep in our sins;
and the wicked one getting the
dominion over us, stir us up, and
shut us out of the kingdom of the
Lord.

16  Consider this also: although
you have seen so great signs and
wonders done among the people
of the Jews, yet this notwithstanding
the Lord hath forsaken them.

17  Beware, therefore, lest it
happen to us; as it is written
There may be many called, but
few chosen.



CHAPTER IV.

     That Christ was to suffer is proved
     from the prophecies concerning him.

For this cause did our Lord
vouchsafe to give up his body
to destruction, that through the
forgiveness of our sins we might
be sanctified; that is, by the
sprinkling of his blood.

2  Now for what concerns the
things that are written about him,
some belong to the people of the
Jews, and some to us.

3  For thus saith the Scripture;
He was wounded for our transgressions,
he was bruised for our iniquities,
and by his blood we are healed.
He was led as a lamb to the
slaughter, and as a sheep before
his shearers is dumb, so he
opened not his mouth.

4  Wherefore we ought the more
to give thanks unto God, for that
he hath both declared unto us
what is passed, and not suffered
us to be without understanding of
those things that are to come.

5  But to them he saith; The
nets are not unjustly spread for
the birds.

6  This he spake, because a man
will justly perish, if having the
knowledge of the way of truth, he
shall nevertheless not refrain
himself from the way of darkness.

7  And for this cause the Lord
was content to suffer for our souls,
although he be the Lord of the
whole earth; to whom God said
before the beginning of the world,
Let us make man after our own
image and likeness.

8  Now how he suffered for us,
seeing it was by men that he
underwent it, I will shew you.

9  The prophets having received
from him the gifts of prophecy,
spake before concerning him:

10  But he, that he might
abolish death, and make known the
resurrection from the dead, was
content, as it was necessary, to
appear in the flesh, that he might
make good the promise before given
to our fathers, and preparing
himself a new people, might
demonstrate to them whilst he was
upon earth, that after the
resurrection he would judge
the world.

11  And finally, teaching the
people of Israel, and doing many
wonders and signs among them,
he preached to them, and shewed
the exceeding great love which
he bare towards them.

12  And when he chose his apostles,
which were afterwards to publish
his Gospel, he took men who had
been very great sinners; that
thereby he might plainly shew
That he came not to call the
righteous but sinners to
repentance.

13  Then he clearly manifested
himself to be the Son of God.
For had he not come in the flesh,
how should men have been able to
look upon him, that they might be
saved?

14  Seeing that if they beheld
only the sun, which was the work
of his hands, and shall hereafter
cease to be, they are not able to
endure stedfastly to look against
the rays of it;

15  Wherefore the Son of God
came in the flesh for this cause,
that he might fill up the measure
of their iniquity, who have
persecuted his prophets unto
death. And for the same reason
also he suffered.

16  For God hath said of the
stripes of his flesh, that they were
from them. And, I will smite the
shepherd, and the sheep of the
flock shall be scattered.

17  Thus he would suffer, because
it behoved him to suffer upon the
cross.

18  For thus one saith,
prophesying concerning him;
Spare my soul from the sword.
And again, My flesh trembleth
for fear.

19  And again, the congregation
of wicked doers rose up against
me, (They have pierced my
hands and my feet).

20  And again he saith, I gave
my back to the smiters, and my
face I set as a hard rock.



CHAPTER V.

The subject continued.

And when he had fulfilled the
commandment of God, What
says he? Who will contend with
me? Let him stand against me
or who is he that will implead
me? Let him draw near to the
servant of the Lord. Woe be to
you! Because ye shall all wax
old as a garment, the moth
shall eat you up.

2  And again adds the prophet,
He is put for a stone of
stumbling. Behold I lay in Zion
for a foundation, a precious
stone a choice corner-stone;
an honourable stone. And what
follows? And he that hopeth
in him shall live for ever.

3  What then? Is our hope built
upon a stone? God forbid. But
because the Lord hath hardened
his flesh against sufferings, he
saith, I have put me as a firm
rock.

4  And again the prophet adds;
The stone which the builders
refused has become the head of
the corner. And again he saith
This is the great and wonderful
day which the Lord hath made.
a I write these things the more
plainly to you that ye may
understand: I For indeed I
could be content even to die
for your sakes.

5  But what saith the prophet
again; The counsel of the wicked
encompassed me about. They
came about me, as bees about the
honey-comb: and, Upon my vesture
they cast lots.

6  Forasmuch then as our Saviour
was to appear in the flesh and
suffer, his passion was hereby
foretold.

7  For thus saith the prophet
against Israel: "Woe be to their
soul because they have taken
wicked counsel against themselves,
saying; let us lay snares for the
righteous, because he is
unprofitable to us."

8  Moses also in like manner
speaketh to them; Behold thus
saith the Lord God; Enter ye
into the good land of which the
Lord path sworn to Abraham, and
Isaac, and Jacob, that he would
give it you, and possess it; a land
flowing with milk and honey.

9  Now what the spiritual meaning
of this is, learn; It is as if it
had been said, Put your trust in
Jesus, who shall be manifested to
you in the flesh. For man is the
earth which suffers: forasmuch
as out of the substance of the
earth Adam was formed.

10  What therefore does he mean
when he says, Into a good land
flowing with milk and honey?
Blessed be our Lord, who has
given us wisdom, and a heart to
understand his secrets. For so
says the prophet, "Who shall
understand the hard sayings of the
Lord? But he that is wise, and
intelligent, and that loves his
Lord."

11  Seeing therefore he has
renewed us by the remission of our
sins, he has put us into another
frame, that we should have souls
like those of children, forming
us again himself by the spirit.

12  For thus the Scripture saith
concerning us, where it introduceth
the Father speaking to the Son;
Let us make man after our likeness
and similitude; and let them have
dominion over the beasts of the
earth, and over the fowls of the
air, and the fish of the sea.

13  And when the Lord saw the
man which he had formed, that
behold he was very good; he said,
Increase and multiply, and
replenish the earth. And this
he spake to his son.

14  I will now show you, how he
made us a new creature, in the
latter days.

15 The Lord saith; Behold I
will make the last as the first.
Wherefore the prophet thus spake,
Enter into the land flowing with
milk and honey, and have dominion
over it.

16  Wherefore ye see how we
are again formed anew; as also
he speaks by another prophet;
Behold saith the Lord, I will take
from them; that is, from those
whom the spirit I of the Lord
foresaw, their hearts of stone,
and I will put into them hearts
of flesh.

17  Because he was about to be
made manifest in the flesh and to
dwell in us.

18  For, my brethren, the
habitation of our heart is a 'holy
temple unto the Lord. For the prophet
saith again, In what place shall I
appear before the Lord my God,
and be glorified?

19  He answers I will confess
unto thee in the congregation in
the midst of my brethren; and will
sing unto thee in the church of
the saints:

20  Wherefore we are they whom
he has brought into that good land.

21  But what signifies the milk
and honey?  Because as the child
is nourished first with milk, and
then with honey; so we being
kept alive by the belief of his
promises and his word, shall live
and have dominion over the land.

22  For he foretold before, saying,
increase and multiply, and have
dominion over the beasts, fishes,
and birds.

23  But who is there that is now
able to have this dominion over
the wild beasts, or fishes, or fowls
of the air? For you know that to
rule, is to have power; that a man
should be set over what he rules.

24  But forasmuch as this we
have not now, he tells us when we
shall have it; namely, when we
shall become perfect, that we may
be made the inheritors of the
covenant of the Lord.



CHAPTER VI.

     The sacrifice of Jesus, and of a goat,
     an evident type of Christ crucified.

UNDERSTAND then my beloved
children, that the good God hath
before manifested all things unto
us, that we might know to whom
we ought always to give thanks
and praise.

2  If therefore the Son of God
who is the Lord of all, and shall
come to judge both the quick and
dead, hath suffered, that by his
stripes we might live; let us
believe that the Son of God could
not have suffered but for us. But
being crucified, they gave him
vinegar and gall to drink.

3  Hear therefore how the priests
of the temple did foreshow this
also: the Lord by his command
which was written, declared that
whosoever did not fast the
appointed fast he should die the
death: because he also was himself
one day to offer up his body for
our sins; that so the type of
what was done in Isaac might be
fulfilled, who was offered upon the
altar.

4  What therefore is it that he
says by the prophet? And let
them eat of the goat which is
offered in the day of the fast for
all their sins. Hearken diligently,
(my brethren,) and all the priests,
and they only shall eat the inwards
not washed with vinegar.

5  Why so? because I know
that when I shall hereafter offer
my flesh for the sins of a new
people, ye will give me vinegar to
drink mixed with gall; therefore
do ye only eat, the people fasting
the while, and lamenting in
sackcloth and ashes.

6  And that he might foreshow
that he was to suffer for them,
hear then how he appointed it.

7  Take, says he, two goats, fair
and alike, and offer them; and let
the high priest take one of them
for a burnt offering.    And what
shalt be done with the other? Let
it, says he, be accursed.

8  Consider how exactly this
appears to have been a type of
Jesus. And let all the congregation
spit upon it, and prick it; and
put the scarlet wool about its
head; and thus let it be carried
forth into the wilderness.

9  And this being done, he that
was appointed to convey the goat,
led it into the wilderness, and
took away the scarlet wool, and
put it upon a thorn bush, whose
young sprouts, when we find
them in the field, we are wont to
eat: so the fruit of that thorn
only is sweet.

10  And to what end was this
ceremony? Consider; one was
offered upon the altar, the
other was accursed.

11  And why was that which was
accursed crowned? Because they
shall see Christ on that day having
a scarlet garment about his body;
and shall say: Is not this he whom
we crucified; having despised him,
pierced him, mocked him? Certainly,
this is he, who then said,
that he was the Son of God.

12  As therefore he shall be
then like to what he was on
earth, so were the Jews heretofore
commanded, to take two goats fair
and equal; that when they shall
see (our Saviour) hereafter coming
(in the clouds of heaven), they may
be amazed at the likeness of the
goats.

13  Wherefore ye here again
see a type of Jesus who was to
suffer for us.

14  But what then signifies this,
That the wool was to be put into
the midst of the thorns?

15  This also is a figure of Jesus,
set out to the church. For as he who
would take away the scarlet wool
must undergo many difficulties,
because that thorn was very sharp,
and with difficulty get it:  So,
says Christ, they that will see me,
and come to my kingdom, must
through many afflictions and
troubles attain unto me.



CHAPTER VII.

     The red heifer, another type of Christ.

BUT what type do ye suppose
it to have been, where it is
commanded to the people of Israel,
that grown persons in whom sins
are come to perfection, should
offer an heifer, and after they had
killed it should burn the same;

2  But then young men should
take up the ashes and put them in
vessels; and tie a piece of scarlet
wool and hyssop upon a stick, and
so the young men should sprinkle
every one of the people, and they
should be clear from their sins?

3  Consider how all these are
delivered in a figure to us.

4  This heifer is Jesus Christ;
the wicked men that were to offer
it are those sinners who brought
him to death; who afterwards have
no more to do with it: for the
sinners have no more the honour
of handling it:

5  But the young men that performed
the sprinkling, signified those who
preach to us the forgiveness of
sins, and the purification of the
heart, to whom the Lord gave
authority to preach his Gospel:
being at the beginning twelve,
to signify the tribes, because
there were twelve tribes of Israel.

6  But why were there three
young men appointed to sprinkle?
To denote Abraham, and Isaac,
and Jacob, because they were
great before God.

7  And why was the wool put
upon a stick? Because the kingdom
of Jesus was founded upon the cross;
and therefore they that put their
trust in him, shall live for ever.

8  But why was the wool and
hyssop put together? To signify
that in the kingdom of Christ there
shall be evil and filthy days, in
which however, we shall be saved;
and because he that has any disease
in the flesh by some filthy humours,
is cured by hyssop.

9  Wherefore these things being
thus done, are to us indeed evident,
but to the Jews they are obscure;
because they hearkened not unto
the voice of the Lord.



CHAPTER VIII.

     Of the circumcision of the ears and how in the
     first institution of circumcision Abraham
     mystically foretold Christ by name.

AND therefore the Scripture
again speaks concerning our
ears, that God has circumcised
them, together with our hearts.
For thus saith the Lord by the
holy prophet: By the hearing of
the ear they obeyed me.

2  And again, They who are afar
off, shall hear and understand
what things I have done. And
again, Circumcise your hearts,
saith the Lord.

3  And again be saith, Hear O
Israel! For thus saith the Lord
thy God. And again the Spirit of
God prophesieth, saying: Who is
there that would live for ever, let
him hear the voice of my Son.

4  And again, Hear, O Heavens,
and give ear O Earth! Because
the Lord has spoken these things
for a witness.

5  And again, he saith, Hear
the word of the Lord, ye princes
of the people. And again, Hear
O children!  The voice of one
crying in the wilderness.

6  Wherefore he has circumcised
our ears, that we should hear his
word, and believe.  But as for
that circumcision, in which the
Jews trust, it is abolished: for the
circumcision of which God spake,
was not of the flesh.

7  But they have transgressed
his commands, because the evil
one hath deceived them. For
thus God bespeaks them; Thus
saith the Lord your God, (Here I
find the new law) Sow not among
thorns; but circumcise yourselves
to the Lord your God. And what
doth he mean by this saying?
Hearken unto your Lord.

8  And again he saith, Circumcise
the hardness of your heart, and
harden not your neck. And again,
Behold, saith the Lord, all the
nations are uncircumcised, (they
have not lost their fore-skin): but
this people is uncircumcised in
heart.

9  But you will say the Jews
were circumcised for a sign. And
so are all the Syrians and Arabians,
and all the idolatrous priests: but
are they therefore of the covenant
of Israel? And even the Egyptians
themselves are circumcised.

10  Understand therefore, children,
these things more fully, that
Abraham was the first, that
brought in circumcision, looking
forward in the Spirit, to Jesus;
circumcised, having received the
mystery of three letters.

11  For the Scripture says that
Abraham circumcised three hundred
and eighteen men of his house.
But what therefore was the mystery
that was made known unto him!

12  Mark, first the eighteen, and
next the three hundred. For the
numeral letters of ten and eight
are T H.  And these denote Jesus.

13  And because the cross was
that by which we were to find
grace, therefore he adds, three
hundred; the note of which is T
(the figure of his cross).
Wherefore by two letters he
signified Jesus, and by the
third his cross.

14  He who has put the engrafted
gift of his doctrine within us,
knows that I never taught to
anyone a more certain truth: but I
trust that ye are worthy of it.



CHAPTER IX.

     That the commands of Moses concerning clean and unclean
     beasts, were all designed for a spiritual signification.

BUT why did Moses say Ye
shall not eat of the swine,
neither the eagle nor the hawk;
nor the crow; nor any fish that
has not a scale upon him?--I
answer that, in the spiritual sense,
he comprehended three doctrines,
that were to be gathered from
thence.

2  Besides which he says to them
in the book of Deuteronomy, And
I will give my statutes unto this
people. Wherefore it is not the
command of God that they should
not eat these things; but Moses in
the spirit spake unto them.

3  Now the sow he forbad them
to eat; meaning thus much: Thou
shalt not join thyself to such
persons as are like unto swine,
who, whilst they live in pleasure,
forget their God; but when any want
pinches them, then they know the
Lord: as the sow when she is full
knows not her master, but when
she is hungry she makes a noise;
and being again fed, is silent.

4  Neither, says he, shalt thou
eat the eagle, nor the hawk, nor
the kite, nor the crow; that is,
thou shalt not keep company with
such kind of men as know not how
by their labour and sweat to get
themselves food; but injuriously
ravish away the things of others,
and watch how to lay snares for
them; when at the same time they
appear to live in perfect innocence.

3  So these birds alone (seek not
food for themselves,) but sitting
idle, seek how they may eat of the
flesh others have provided being
destructive through their
wickedness.

6  Neither, says he, shalt thou
eat the lamprey, nor the polypus,
nor the cuttle-fish; that is thou
shalt not be like such men, by
seeking to converse with them
who are altogether wicked and
adjudged to death. For so those
fishes are alone accursed, that
wallow in the mire, nor swim as other
fishes, but tumble in the dirt at
the bottom of the deep.

7  But, he adds, neither shalt
thou eat of the hare. To what
end?--To signify this to us;
Thou shalt not be an adulterer,
nor liken thyself to such persons.
For the hare every year multiplies
the places of its conception; and
as many years as it lives, so many
it has.

8  Neither shalt thou eat of the
hyena: that is, again, be not an
adulterer, nor a corrupter of
others; neither be like to such.
And wherefore so?--Because that
creature every year changes its
kind, which is sometimes male
and sometimes female.

9  For which cause also he justly
hated the weazel; to the end that
they should not be like such
persons who with their mouths
commit wickedness by reason of
their uncleanness; nor join
themselves with those impure women,
who with their mouths commit
wickedness. Because that animal
conceives with its mouth.

10  Moses, therefore, speaking
as concerning meats, delivered
indeed three great precepts to
them in the spiritual signification
of those commands. But they
according to the desires of the
flesh, understood him as if he
had only meant it of meats.

11  And therefore David took
aright the knowledge of his
three-fold command, saying in
like manner:

12  Blessed is the man that hath
not walked in the counsel of the
ungodly; as the fishes before
mentioned in the bottom of the
deep, in darkness.

13  Nor stood in the way of
sinners, as they who seem to fear
the Lord, but yet sin, as the sow.

14  And hath not sat in the seat
of the scorners; as those birds
who sit and watch that they may
devour.

15  Here you have the law
concerning meat perfectly set
forth and according to the
true knowledge of it.

16  But, says Moses, ye shall
eat all that divideth the hoof, and
cheweth the cud. Signifying
thereby such an one as having
taken his food, knows him that
nourisheth him; and resting upon
him, rejoiceth in him.

17  And in this he spake well,
having respect to the commandment.
What, therefore, is it that
he says?--That we should hold
fast to them that fear the Lord;
with those who meditate on the
command of the word which they
have received, in their heart;
with those that declare the
righteous judgments of the Lord,
and keep his commandments;

18  In short, with those who
know that to meditate is a work
of pleasure, and therefore exercise
themselves in the word of the
Lord.

19  But why might they eat
those that clave the hoof?
Because the righteous liveth in this
present world; but his expectation
is fixed upon the other. See,
brethren, how admirably Moses
commanded these things.

20  But how should we thus
know all this, and understand it?
We, therefore, understanding
aright the commandments, speak
as the Lord would have us.
Wherefore he has circumcised our
ears and our hearts, that we might
know these things.



CHAPTER X.

     Baptism and the cross of Christ
     foretold in figures under the law.

LET us now inquire whether
the Lord took care to manifest
anything beforehand concerning water
and the cross.

2  Now for the former of these,
it is written to the people of
Israel how they shall not receive
that baptism which brings to
forgiveness of sins; but shall
institute another to themselves
that cannot.

3  For thus saith the prophet:
Be astonished, O Heaven! and
let the earth tremble at it, because
this people have done two great
and wicked things: they have left
me, the fountain of living water,
and have digged for themselves
broken cisterns, that can hold no
water.

4  Is my holy mountain of Zion,
a desolate wilderness? For ye
shall be as a young bird when its
nest is taken away.

5 And again the prophet saith,
I will go before thee, and will
make plain the mountains, and
will break the gates of brass, and
will snap in sunder the bars of
iron; and will give thee dark,
and hidden, and invisible
treasures, that they may know
that I am the Lord God.

6  And again: he shall dwell
in the high den of the strong
rock. And then, what follows in
the same prophet? His water is
faithful; ye shall see the king
with glory, and your soul shall
learn the fear of the Lord.

7  And again he saith in another
prophet: He that does these
things;   I shall be like a tree
planted by the currents of water,
which shall give its fruit in its
season. Its leaf also shall not
wither, and whatsoever he doth
it shall prosper.

8  As for the wicked it is not
so with them; but they are as the
dust which the wind scattereth
away from the face of the earth.

9  Therefore the ungodly shall
not stand in the judgment, neither
the sinners in the council of the
righteous. For the Lord knoweth
the way of the righteous, and the
way of the ungodly shall perish.

10  Consider how he has joined
both the cross and the water
together.

11  For this he saith: Blessed
are they who put their trust in the
cross, and descend into the water;
for they shall have their reward in
due time: then, saith he, will I
give it them.

12  But as concerning the present
time, he saith, their leaves shall
not fall: meaning thereby, that
every word that shall go out of
your mouth, shall through faith
and charity be to the conversion
and hope of many.

13  In like manner doth another
prophet speak. And the land of
Jacob was the praise of all the
earth; magnifying thereby the
vessel of his spirit.

14  And what follows?--And
there was a river running on the
right hand, and beautiful trees
grew up by it; and he that shall
eat of them shall live for ever.
The signification of which is this
that we go down into the water
full of sins and pollutions, but
come up again, bringing forth
fruit; having in our hearts the
fear and hope which is in Jesus,
by the spirit. And whosoever
shall eat of them shall live for
ever.

15  That is, whosoever shall
hearken to those who call them, and
shall believe, shall live for ever.



CHAPTER XI.

     The subject continued.

IN like manner he determines
concerning the cross in another
prophet, saying: And when shall
these things be fulfilled?

2  The Lord answers: When the
tree that is fallen shall rise, and
when blood shall drop down from
the tree. Here you have again
mention made, both of the cross,
and of him that was to be crucified
upon it.

3  And yet farther he saith by
Moses; (when Israel was fighting
with, and beaten by, a strange
people; to the end that God might
put them in mind how that for
their sins they were delivered unto
death) yea, the holy spirit put it
into the heart of Moses, to represent
both the sign of the cross, and of
him that was to suffer: that so
they might know that if they did
not believe in him, they should be
overcome for ever.

4  Moses therefore I piled up
armour upon armour in the middle
of a rising ground, and standing
up high above all of them, stretched
forth his arms, and so Israel again
conquered.

5  But no sooner did he let down
his hands, but they were again
slain. And why so?--To the end
they might know, that except they
trust in him they cannot be saved.

6  And in another prophet, he
saith, I have stretched out my
hands all the day long to a people
disobedient, and speaking against
my righteous way.

7  And again Moses makes a
type of Jesus, to show that he was
to die, and then that he, whom
they thought to be dead, was to
give life to others; in the type
of those that fell in Israel.

8  For God caused all sorts of
serpents to bite them, and they
died: forasmuch as by a serpent
transgression began in Eve; that
so he might convince them that
for their transgressions they shall
be delivered into the pain of death.

9  Moses then himself, who had
commanded them, saying, Ye shall
not make to yourselves any graven
or molten image, to be your God
yet now did so himself, that he
might represent to them the figure
of the Lord Jesus.

10  For he made a brazen
serpent, and set it up on high,
and called the people together
by a proclamation: where being come,
they entreated Moses that he would
make an atonement for them, and
pray that they might be healed.

11  Then Moses spake unto them,
saying: when any one among you
shall be bitten, let him come unto
the serpent that is set upon the
pole; and let him assuredly trust
in him, that though he be dead,
yet he is able to give life, and
presently he shall be saved; and so
they did. See therefore how here
also you have in this the glory of
Jesus; and that in him and to
him are all things.

12  Again; What says Moses to
Joshua, the Son of Nun, when he
gave that name unto him, as being
a prophet, that all the people might
hear him alone?  Because the
father did manifest all things
concerning his son Jesus, in Joshua,
the Son of Nun; and gave him
that name when he sent him to spy
out the land of Canaan, saying;
Take a book in thine hands,
and write what the Lord saith.
Forasmuch as Jesus the Son of God
shall in the last days cut off by the
roots all the house of Amalek, see
here again Jesus, not the son of
man, but the Son of God, made
manifest in a type, and in the flesh.

13  But because it might hereafter
be said that Christ was the
Son of David; therefore David
fearing and well knowing the errors
of the wicked, saith; the Lord
said unto my Lord, sit thou on my
right hand until I make thine
enemies thy footstool.

14  And again Isaiah speaketh
on this wise, The Lord said unto
Christ my Lord, I have laid hold
on his right hand, that the nations
should obey before him, and I will
break the strength of kings.

15  Behold, how doth David and
Isaiah call him Lord, and the Son
of God.



CHAPTER XII.

     The Promise of God not made to the Jews only,
     but to the Gentiles also, and fulfilled to us by Jesus Christ.

BUT let us go yet further, and
inquire whether this people be
the heir, or the former; and
whether the covenant be with us
or with them.

2  And first, as concerning
the people, hear now what the
Scripture saith:

3  Isaac prayed for his wife
Rebekah, because she was barren;
and she conceived. Afterwards
Rebekah went forth to inquire
of the Lord.

4  And the Lord said unto her;
There are two nations in thy womb,
and two people shall come from
thy body; and the one shall have
power over the other, and the
greater shall serve the lesser.
Understand here who was Isaac;
who Rebekah; and of whom it was
foretold, this people shall be
greater than that.

5  And in another prophecy Jacob
speaketh more clearly to his
son Joseph, saying; Behold the
Lord hath not derived me of seeing
thy face, bring me thy sons that
I may bless them. And he brought
unto his father Manasseh and
Ephraim, desiring that he should
bless Manasseh, because he was
the elder.

6  Therefore Joseph brought him
to the right hand of his father
Jacob. But Jacob by the spirit
foresaw the figure of the people
that was to come.

7  And what saith the Scripture?
And Jacob crossed his hands, and
put his right hand upon Ephraim,
his second, and the younger son,
and blessed him. And Joseph said
unto Jacob; Put thy right hand
upon the head of Manasseh, for he
is my first-born son. And Jacob
said unto Joseph; I know it, my
son, I know it; but the greater
shall serve the lesser; though he
also shall be blessed.

8  Ye see of whom he appointed
it, that they should be the first
people, and heirs of the covenant.

9  If therefore God shall have
yet farther taken notice of this,
by Abraham too; our understanding
of it will then be perfectly
established.

10  What then saith the Scripture
of Abraham, when I he believed,
and it was imputed unto him for
righteousness? Behold I have made
thee a father of the nations,
which without circumcision believe
in the Lord.

11  Let us therefore now inquire
whether God has fulfilled the
covenant, which he sware to our
fathers, that he would give this
people? Yes, verily, he gave it;
but they were not worthy to receive
it by reason of their sins.

12  For thus saith the prophet
And Moses continued fasting in
mount Sinai, to receive the covenant
of the Lord with the people, forty
days and forty nights.

13  And he received of the Lord
two tables written with the finger
of the Lord's hand, in the Spirit.
And Moses, when he had received
them, brought them down that he
might deliver them to the people.

14  And the Lord said unto
Moses; Moses, Moses, get thee
down quickly, for the people which
thou broughtest out of the land of
Egypt have done wickedly.

15  And Moses understood that
they had again set up a molten
image: and he cast the two tables
out of his hands; and the tables
of the covenant of the Lord were
broken. Moses therefore received
them, but they were not worthy.

16  Now then learn how we have
received them. Moses, being a
servant, took them; but the Lord
himself has given them unto us,
that we might be the people of his
inheritance; having suffered for
us.

17  He was therefore made
manifest; that they should fill
up the measure of their sins,
and that we being made heirs by
him, should receive the covenant
of the Lord Jesus.

18  And again the prophet saith
Behold, I have set thee for a light
unto the Gentiles; to be the saviour
of all the ends of the earth, saith
the Lord; the God who hath re-deemed
thee.

19  Who for that very end
was prepared, that by his own
appearing he might redeem our
hearts, already devoured by
death, and delivered over to
the irregularity of error,
from darkness; and establish
a covenant with us by his word.

20  For so it is written that the
father commanded him by delivering
us from darkness, to prepare unto
himself a holy people.

21  Wherefore the prophet saith
I the Lord thy God have called
thee in righteousness, and I will
take thee by thy hand, and will
strengthen thee, and give thee
for a covenant of the people; for a
light to the Gentiles. To open the
eyes of the blind, to bring out the
prisoners from the prison, and them
that sit in darkness out of the
prison house.

22  Consider, therefore, from
whence we have been redeemed.
And again the prophet saith
The spirit of the Lord is upon me,
because he hath anointed me: he
hath sent me to preach glad tidings
to the lowly; to heal the broken in
heart; to preach remission to the
captives, and give sight unto the
blind; to proclaim the acceptable
year of the Lord, and the day of
restitution; to comfort all that
mourn.



CHAPTER XIII.

     That the sabbath of the Jews was but a figure
     of a more glorious sabbath to come, and their
     temple, of the spiritual temples of God.

FURTHERMORE it is written
concerning the sabbath, in the
Ten Commandments, which God
spake in the mount Sinai to Moses,
face to face: Sanctify the sabbath
of the Lord with pure hands, and
with a clean heart.

2  And elsewhere he saith;
If thy children shall keep my
Sabbaths, then will I put my
mercy upon them.

3  And even in the beginning of
the creation he makes mention of
the sabbath. And God made in
six days the works of his hands,
and he finished them on the seventh
day; and he rested the seventh
day, and sanctified it.

4  Consider, my children, what
that signifies, he finished them
in six days. The meaning of it is
this: that in six thousand years
the Lord God will bring all things
to an end.

5  For with him one day is
a thousand years; as himself
testifieth, saying, Behold this
day shall be as a thousand years.
Therefore, children, in six days,
that is, in six thousand years,
shall a all things be accomplished.

6  And what is that he saith,
And he rested the seventh day
he meaneth this: that when
his Son shall come, and abolish
the season of the Wicked One,
and judge the ungodly; and shall
change the sun and the moon, and
the stars; then he shall gloriously
rest on that seventh day,

7  He adds, lastly: Thou shalt
sanctify it with clean hands and
a pure heart. Wherefore we are
greatly deceived if we imagine
that anyone can now sanctify that
day which God has made holy,
without having a heart pure in
all things.

8  Behold, therefore, he will then
truly sanctify it with blessed rest,
when we (having received the
righteous promise, when iniquity
shall be no more, all things being
renewed by the Lord) shall be able
to sanctify it, being ourselves first
made holy;

9  Lastly, he saith unto them
Your new moons and your Sabbaths
I cannot bear them. Consider
what he means by it; the
Sabbaths, says he, which ye now
keep are not acceptable unto me,
but those which I have made;
when resting from all things I
shall begin the eight day, that is,
the beginning of the other world.

10  For which cause we observe
the eight day with gladness, in
which Jesus rose from the dead;
and having manifested himself to
his disciples, ascended into heaven.

11  It remains yet that I
speak to you concerning the temple:
how those miserable men being
deceived have put their trust
in the house, and not in God
himself who made them, as if
it were the habitation of God.

12  For much after the same
manner as the Gentiles, they
consecrated him in the temple.

13  But learn therefore how
the Lord speaketh, rendering the
temple vain: Who has measured the
heaven with a span, and the earth
with his hand? Is it not I? Thus
with the Lord, Heaven is my
throne, and the earth is my
footstool. What is the house
that ye will build me? Or what
is the place of my rest? Know
therefore that all their hope
is vain.

14  And again he speaketh after
this manner: Behold they that
destroy this temple, even they
shall again build it up. And so
it came to pass; for through their
wars it is now destroyed by their
enemies; and the servants of their
enemies build it up.

15  Furthermore it has been
made manifest, how both the city
and the temple, and the people of
Israel should be given up. For
the scripture saith; And it shall
come to pass in the last days, that
the Lord will deliver up the sheep
of his pasture, and their fold, and
their tower unto destruction. And
it is come to pass, as the Lord hath
spoken.

16  Let us inquire therefore,
whether there be any temple of
God? Yes there is: and there
where himself declares that he
would both make and perfect it.
For it is written: And it shall
be that as soon as the week shall
be completed, the temple of the
Lord shall be gloriously built in
the name of the Lord.

17  I find therefore that there
is a temple. But how shall it be
built in the name of the Lord? I
will shew you.

18  Before that we believed in
God, the habitation of our heart
was corruptible, and feeble, as a
temple truly built with hands.

19  For it was a house full
of idolatry, a house of devils;
inasmuch as there was done in it
whatsoever was contrary unto God.
But it shall be built in the name
of the Lord.

20  Consider, how that the
temple of the Lord shall be very
gloriously built; and by what
means that shall be, learn.

21  Having received remission
of our sins, and trusting in the
name of the Lord, we are become
renewed, being again created as it
were from the beginning. Wherefore
God truly dwells in our house,
that is, in us.

22  But how does he dwell in us?
By the word of his faith, the calling
of his promise, the wisdom of his
righteous judgments and the commands
of his doctrine. He himself prophesies
within us, he himself dwelleth in us,
and openeth to us who were in bondage
of death the gate of our temple,
that is, the mouth of wisdom, having
given repentance unto us; and by this
means has brought us to be an
incorruptible temple.

23  He therefore that desires to
be saved looketh not unto the
man, but unto him that dwelleth
in him, and speaketh by him;
being struck with wonder,
forasmuch as he never either
heard him speaking such words
out of his mouth, nor ever
desired to hear them.

24  This is that spiritual temple
that is built unto the Lord.



CHAPTER XIV.

     Of the way of light; being a summary of what
     a Christian is to do, that he maybe happy for ever.

AND thus I trust, I have
declared to you as much, and
with as great simplicity as I
could, those, things which provide
for your salvation, so as not to
have omitted any thing that might
be requisite thereunto.

2  For should I speak farther of
the things that now are, and of
those that are to come, you would
not yet understand them, seeing
they lie in parables. This therefore
shall suffice as to these things.

3  Let us now go on to the other
kind of knowledge and doctrine.
There are two ways of doctrine
and power; the one of light, the
other of darkness.

4  But there is a great deal of
difference between these two ways
for over one are appointed the
angels of God, the leaders of
the way of light; over the other,
the angels of Satan. And the one
is the Lord from everlasting to
everlasting; the other is the
prince of the time of
unrighteousness.

5  Now the way of light is this:
If any one desires to attain to the
place that is appointed for him,
and will hasten thither by his
works. And the knowledge that
has been given to us for walking
in it, to this effect: Thou shalt
love him that made thee: thou
shalt glorify him that hath
redeemed thee from death.

6  Thou shalt be simple in heart,
and rich in the spirit.  Thou shalt
not cleave to those that walk in
the way of death.   Thou shalt hate
to do anything that is not pleasing
unto God. Thou shalt abhor all
dissimulation. Thou shalt not
neglect any of the commands of
the Lord.

7  Thou shalt not exalt thyself,
but shalt be humble. Then shalt
not take honour to thyself. Thou
shalt not enter into any wicked
counsel against thy neighbour.
Thou shalt not be over confident
in thy heart.

8  Thou shaft not commit
fornication, nor adultery.
Neither shalt thou corrupt
thyself with mankind. Thou
shalt not make use of the
word of God, to any impurity,

9  Thou shalt not except any
man's person, when thou reprovest
any one's faults. Thou shalt be
gentle. Thou shalt be quiet.
Thou shalt tremble at the words
which thou hast heard. Thou
shalt not keep any hatred in thy
heart against thy brother. Thou
shalt not entertain any doubt
whether it shall be or not.

10  Thou shalt not take the name
of the Lord in vain. Thou shalt
love thy neighbour above thy own
soul,

11  Thou shalt not destroy thy
conceptions, before they are
brought forth; nor kill them
after they are born.

12  Thou shalt not withdraw thy
hand from thy son, or from thy
daughter; but shall teach them
from their youth the fear of the
Lord.

13  Thou shalt not covet thy
neighbour's goods; neither shalt
thou be an extortioner. Neither
shall thy heart be joined to proud
men; but thou shalt be numbered
among the righteous and the
lowly. Whatever events shall
happen unto thee, thou shalt
receive them as good.

14  Thou shalt not be double-
minded or double-tongued; for a
double tongue is the snare of death.
Thou shalt be subject unto the
Lord and to inferior masters as to
the representatives of God, in fear
and reverence.

15  Thou shalt not be bitter in
thy commands towards any of thy
servants that trust in God; lest
thou chance not to fear him who
is over both; because he came not
to call any with respect of persons,
but whomsoever the spirit had
prepared.

16  Thou shalt communicate to
thy neighbour of all thou hast;
thou shalt not call anything
thine own: for if ye partake of
such things as are incorruptible,
how much more should you do it
in those that are corruptible?

17  Thou shalt not be forward to
speak; for the mouth is the snare
of death. Strive for thy soul with
all thy might. Reach not out
thine hand to receive, and
withhold it not when thou
shouldest give.

18  Thou shalt love, as the apple
of thine eye, everyone that speaketh
unto thee the Word of the Lord.
Call to thy remembrance, day and
night, the future judgment.

19  Thou shalt seek out every
day, the persons of the righteous;
and both consider and go about to
exhort others by the word, and
meditate how thou mayest save a
soul.

20  Thou shaft also labour with
thy hands to give to the poor,
that thy sins may be forgiven thee,
Thou shalt not deliberate whether
thou shouldst give; nor having
given, murmur at it.

21  Give to everyone that asks
so shalt thou know who is the good
rewarder of thy gifts.

22  Keep what thou hast received;
thou shalt neither add to it nor
take from it.

23  Let the wicked be always
thy aversion. Thou shalt judge
with righteous judgment. Thou
shalt never cause divisions; but
shalt make peace between those
that are at variance, and bring
them together.

24  Thou shalt confess thy sins;
and not come to thy prayer with
an evil conscience.

25 This is the way of light.



CHAPTER XV.

     Of the way of darkness; that is, what kind of persons
     shall be for ever cast out of the kingdom of God.

BUT the way of darkness is
crooked, and full of cursing.
For it is the way of eternal death,
with punishment; in which they
that walk meet those things that
destroy their own souls.

2  Such are; idolatry, confidence,
pride of power, hypocrisy, double-
mindedness, adultery, murder, rapine,
pride, transgression, deceit, malice,
arrogance, witchcraft, covetousness,
and the want of the fear of God.

3  In this, walk those, who are
the persecutors of them that are
good; haters of truth; lovers of
lies; who know not the reward of
righteousness, nor cleave to any
thing that is good.

4  Who administer not righteous
judgment to the widow and orphan;
who watch for wickedness, and not
for the fear of the Lord;

5  From whom gentleness and
patience are far off: who love
vanity, and follow after rewards;
having no compassion upon the
poor; nor take any pains for such
as are heavy laden and oppressed.

6  Ready to evil speaking,
not knowing him that made them;
murderers of children; corrupters
of the creature of God; that turn
away from the needy; oppress the
afflicted; are the advocates of the
rich, but unjust judges of the poor;
being altogether sinners.

7  It is therefore fitting
that learning the just commands
of the Lord, which we have before
mentioned, we should walk in them.
For he who does such things shall
be glorified in the kingdom of Hod.

8  But he that chooses the other
part, shall be destroyed, together
with his works. For this cause
there shall be both a resurrection,
and a retribution.

9  I beseech those that are in
high estate among you, (if so be
you will take the counsel which
with a good intention I offer to
you,) you have those with you
towards whom you may do good;
do not forsake them.

10  For the day is at hand in
which all things shall be destroyed,
together with the wicked one.
The Lord is near, and his reward
is with him.

11  I beseech you, therefore,
again, and again, Be as good
lawgiver's to one Another; continue
faithful counsellors do each other
remove from among you all hypocrisy.

12  And may God, the Lord
of all the world, give you
wisdom, knowledge, counsel,
and understanding of his
judgments in patience:

13  Be ye taught of God;
seeking what it is the Lord
requires of you, and doing it;
that ye may be saved in the
day of judgment.

14  And if there be among you
any remembrance of what is good,
think of me; meditating on these
things, that both my desire and
my watching for you may turn to
a good account.

15 I beseech you; I ask it as a
favour of you; whilst you are in
this beautiful tabernacle of the
body, be wanting in none of these
things; but without ceasing seek
them, and fulfil every command,
For these things are fitting and
worthy to be done.

16  Wherefore I have given the
more diligence to write unto you
according to my ability, that you
might rejoice. Farewell, children
of love and peace.

17  The Lord of glory and of
all grace, be with your spirit,
Amen.


[The end of the Epistle of Barnabas
the Apostle, and fellow-traveller
of St. Paul the Apostle.]



              REFERENCES TO THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF BARNABAS.

[Barnabas was a companion and fellow-preacher with Paul. This Epistle
lays a greater claim to canonical authority than most others. It has been
cited by  Clemens, Alexandrinus, Origen, Eusebius, and Jerome, and many
ancient Fathers.    Cotelerius affirms that Origen and Jerome esteemed it
genuine and  canonical; but Cotelerius himself did not believe it to be
either one or the  other; on the contrary, he supposes it was written for
the benefit of the  Ebionites, (the christianized Jews,) who were
tenacious of rites and ceremonies.  Bishop Fell feared to own expressly
what he seemed to be persuaded of, that it ought to be treated with the
same respect as several of the books of the present canon.  Dr. Bernard,
Savilian professor at Oxford, not only believed it to be genuine, but
that it was read throughout in the churches of Alexandria, as the
canonical Scriptures were. Dodwell supposed it to have been published
before the Epistle of Jude, and the writings of both the Johns.  Vossius,
Dupuis, Dr. Cane, Dr. Mill, Dr, S. Clark, Whitson, and Archbishop Wake
also esteemed it genuine: Menardus, Archbishop Land, Spanheim, and others
deemed it apocryphal.]

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
