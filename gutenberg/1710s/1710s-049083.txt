                                   AN

                                ACCOUNT

                                 OF THE

                            SPANISH INVASION

                        In the YEAR MDLXXXVIII.


THE Defeat of the SPANISH ARMADA being the most glorious Victory that
was ever obtained at Sea, and the most important to the _British_
Nation, every Method deserves some Praise, that may in a suitable Manner
propagate the Memory of it. Our Ancestors, that were personally
interested in it, were so careful it should not pass into Oblivion, that
they procured the Engagements between the two Fleets to be represented
in ten curious Pieces of Tapestry, with the Portraits of the several
_English_ Captains, taken from the Life, worked in the Borders, which
are now placed, some in the Royal Wardrobe, some in the House of Lords,
the most august Assembly of the Kingdom, there to remain as a lasting
Memorial of the Triumphs of _British_ Valour, guided by _British_
Counsels. But because Time, or Accident, or Moths may deface these
valuable Shadows, we have endeavoured to preserve their Likeness in the
preceding Prints, which, by being multiplied and dispersed in various
Hands, may meet with that Security from the Closets of the Curious,
which the Originals must scarce always hope for, even from the Sanctity
of the Place they are kept in.

Thus far we have been able to go within our own Province; but as a more
particular Detail of the Circumstances of this glorious Expedition,
which lye blended in our Histories with other Matters, may not be
altogether unacceptable, we shall beg Leave to offer the following brief
Account of it, collected from the most authentic Writers and
Manuscripts.


                                SECT. I.


THE Author and Undertaker of this ever memorable Expedition was _Philip_
II. King of _Spain_, eldest Son of the renowned Emperor _Charles_ V. In
the Year 1554, he married _Mary_ I. Queen of _England_, with a View of
uniting, by this Marriage, the _English_ Dominions to those large and
noble Territories of which he was Heir-Apparent. But all his Projects
were defeated by a False-Conception the Queen had in 1555; and
especially by her Death, which happened on _Novemb._ 17, 1558.—In 1555,
_October_ 25, he became King of _Spain_, and the Dominions and
Territories thereunto belonging, upon the voluntary Resignation of his
Father _Charles_ V.

As to King _Philip_’s real Views and Motives in this Expedition, they
seem to have been these:

I. A firm Hope and certain Prospect as he imagin’d, of easily acquiring
so considerable an Addition to his Dominions, as the flourishing
Kingdoms of _England_ and _Ireland_. Kingdoms whose Advantages and
Excellencies he was well acquainted withal; and from whence he could be
continually supplied with Tin, Lead, Wool, and many other useful,
necessary, and profitable Commodities.

II. He was also excited by another Motive, which is generally sufficient
for Conquerors; and it was this: _England_ and _Ireland_ stood very
convenient for him, as being near his Dominions in the Low-Countries;
and might, by their advantageous Situation, and the many good Harbours
they abound with, have rendered him Master of the Trade and Navigation
of these Northern Parts of the World; and, what is more, they would have
enabled him to carry it on throughout all _North_ and _South-America_,
exclusively of all others; which is such an Advantage as cannot well be
expressed.

III. Moreover these Islands had proved, and might always prove a
grievous Thorn in his Side. For, by reason of their Situation, the
_English_ could, at any Time, almost totally obstruct the Navigation of
the _Netherlands_, and destroy all their Traffick by Sea. Because, as it
must unavoidably be carried on almost within Sight of the _British_
Coasts, so long as the Inhabitants of those Islands remained independent
of him[1], and were Masters at Sea, they could seize, with the utmost
Ease, the Shipping sent from the Ports of _Flanders_ to the several
Parts of the World. What lay therefore so convenient, and was in other
Hands so dangerous a Neighbour, must be purchas’d at any Rate.

IV. Revenge may be assigned as another Motive of this Expedition. Queen
_Elizabeth_ had assisted all along the States of the United Provinces,
in their several Attempts to shake off the _Spanish_ Yoke. Now, that
surely was a very great Provocation: And Forgiveness of Injuries, it is
well known, was then, no more than at present, a _Spaniard_’s Virtue. To
be revenged therefore of such a constant Enemy as _Elizabeth_ had been,
may well be suppos’d to have been an additional Inducement to this
Undertaking.

V. This other important Motive is assigned by _Hakluyt_[2]: “King
_Philip_ deemed this to be the most ready and direct Course, to recover
his hereditary Possession of the _Low-Countries_. For, having with
little Advantage, for above twenty Years together, waged War against the
_Netherlands_, after mature Deliberation, he thought it most convenient
to assault them once more by Sea, which had been fruitlessly attempted
several Times before for want of sufficient Forces. And he thought good
to begin with _England_, being persuaded, that the Conquest of that
Island was less difficult than the Conquest of _Holland_ and _Zealand_.
Moreover, the _Spaniards_ were of Opinion, that it would be far more
behoveful for their King to conquer _England_ and the _Low-Countries_ at
once, than to be constrained continually to maintain a warlike Navy, to
defend his _East_ and _West-India_ Fleets from the _English_.”

                  *       *       *       *       *

These (with a Desire of restoring the _Roman-Catholick_ Religion) seem
to have been the real and true Motives of this great Expedition.

The Reasons alleged by _Philip_ were these[3]:


I. That _Elizabeth_ had, from the first assisted his rebellious Subjects
in the _Netherlands_, with Men and Money, and spirited them up against
him, her greatest Friend and Benefactor; whom she was indebted to for
her Life, when her Sister Queen _Mary_ and _Gardiner_ were for removing
her out of the Way.

II. _Drake_, and others of her Subjects, had committed several
Depredations in _Spain_ and _America_.

III. She had been so unnatural as to stop his Money, when, for fear of
Pirates, it had been landed in her Dominions; and had put an Embargo on
the Vessels employed to carry it to the _Low-Countries_: (As is related
by _Camden_, under the Year 1568.)

IV. She had acknowledged his Enemy Don _Antonio_ King of _Portugal_, and
armed him against _Spain_.

V. That it was by her Instruction and Advice the Duke of _Alençon_ had
been crowned King of _Brabant_.

VI. And, moreover, she herself had accepted the Sovereignty of the
_Low-Countries_, and sent the Earl of _Leicester_ thither with
considerable Forces; which was an open Declaration of War.

VII. That he undertook it, to revenge the Death of the innocent Queen of
_Scots_.

VIII. And in Compliance with the Holy Father _Innocent_ VIII.’s earnest
Injunctions, who ceased not to exhort and importune him, to abolish
Heresy in _England_, and replant the _Roman-Catholick_ Religion there.

                  *       *       *       *       *

In short therefore, the Aim and Design of the King of _Spain_ in this
great Expedition, was to conquer _England_, in order to come more easily
at the revolted _Netherlands_, and facilitate their Reduction to his
Obedience; as also, for the Sake of so meritorious an Action, as the
bringing this Island back to the Catholick Religion: And to be revenged,
at the same Time, for the Disgrace, Contempt, and Dishonour, he had, at
several Times, received from the _English_ Nation; and for divers others
real or pretended Injuries, which had made a deep Impression on his
proud and revengeful Spirit.

Animated and spurred on by these Motives, King _Philip_ made such vast
Preparations for his intended Conquest, as had hardily ever been known
before in any Age, or Nation: Whether we consider the Time spent about
them; or the prodigious Strength and Quantity of the Materials of all
Kinds that were provided.

As for the Time spent about these Preparations; King _Philip_ seems to
have form’d this Design as early as the Year 1583. [4]For, in that Year,
he ordered _Alexander_ Duke of _Parma_, Governor of the _Low-Countries_,
to procure an exact Account and Description of the Harbours, Castles,
Rivers, and Roads belonging to _England_, and transmit them to him;
which was accordingly done: And in this _Francis Throckmorton_ appears
to have been concerned. But, according to _Rapin_, [5]this Project was
formed by _Philip_ only from the Time _Mary_ Queen of _Scots_ had been
persuaded to convey to him her Right to _England_, as being the only
Means to restore the _Catholick_ Religion[6]: According to the received
Maxim in the Church of _Rome_, That an Heretick is unworthy and
incapable of enjoying a Crown; _Philip_ thought he might justly claim
that of _England_, as being the next _Catholick_ Prince descended from
the House of _Lancaster_; namely, from _Catharine_ Daughter of _John_ of
_Ghent_ Duke of _Lancaster_, married in 1389 to _Henry_, then Prince,
and afterwards King, of _Castile_. Upon this Descent therefore, and the
Queen of _Scots_ Conveyance and Will, he had projected the Conquest of
_England_.

However it be, or whenever these Preparations were begun, it is certain
that King _Philip_ assembled so powerful a Fleet, and so well furnished
with all kinds of Provisions and Ammunition, that, thinking it
unconquerable by human Power, he gave it the Title of the INVINCIBLE
ARMADA.

[7]This Fleet consisted of one hundred and thirty two Ships, (besides
twenty Caravels for the Service of the Army, and ten Salves with six
Oars apiece,) containing fifty nine thousand one hundred, and twenty
Tons; three thousand, one hundred, and sixty five Cannons; eight
thousand, seven hundred, and sixty six Sailors; two thousand and eighty
eight Galley-Slaves, and twenty one thousand, eight hundred, and fifty
five Soldiers; besides Noblemen and Voluntiers[8]. For there was not a
Family in _Spain_ of any Note, but what had a Son, a Brother, or a
Kinsman in the Fleet[9]. Of these Voluntiers there were two hundred and
twenty four; attended by four hundred and fifty six Servants bearing
Arms.

There were also two hundred and thirty eight Gentlemen more, maintained
by the King; with one hundred and sixty three Servants. An hundred and
seventy seven Persons, with two Engineers, one Physician, one Surgeon,
and thirty Servants belonging to the Artillery; eighty five Physicians
and Surgeons for the Hospital-Ships; three and twenty Gentlemen
belonging to the Duke of _Medina-Sidonia_’s Court, and fifty Servants;
seventeen Superintendants General of the Army; and one hundred Servants
more, belonging to them, or to the Officers of Justice, who were twenty
in Number[10].

Nay even there were in it one hundred and eighty Capuchins, Dominicans,
Jesuits, and Mendicant Friars; with _Martin Alarco_, Vicar of the
Inquisition.

And because none were allowed to have Wives or Concubines on board, some
Women had hired Ships to follow the Fleet; two or three of which Ships
were driven by the Storm on the Coast of _France_[11].

Most of the Ships of this ARMADA[12] were of an uncommon Size, Strength,
and Thickness, more like floating Castles than any thing else; and they
were cased above Water with thick Planks to hinder the Cannon-Balls from
piercing their Sides. The Masts also were braced round with strong
pitched Ropes, to save them from being soon shatter’d or broke by the
Shot.

Then as to Ammunition, [13]this Fleet had a very great Number of
Cannons, double Cannons, Culverins, and Field-Pieces for Land-Service;
seven thousand Muskets and Calievers; ten thousand Halberts and
Partizans; one hundred and twenty thousand Cannon-Balls; [14]one hundred
Quintals of Lead for Bullets (each Quintal being a hundred weight,)
twelve thousand Quintals of Match; fifty six thousand Quintals of
Gunpowder; and also, Waggons, and other Carriages; Horses, Mules, and
other Instruments and Necessaries for Conveyance by Land; Torches,
Lanthorns, Canvas, Hides, Lead; Chains, Whips, Butchering-Knives,
Halters, and other Instruments of Death and Slavery[15]; and Spades,
Mattocks, Baskets, and every thing else requisite for Pioneers Work; as
also eight hundred Mules for drawing the Ordnance and Carriages.

Proportionable to these Forces was their great Store of Provisions of
every Sort: [16]for, besides Raisins in great abundance, they had eight
thousand Quintals of Fish; three thousand Quintals of Rice; six thousand
three hundred and twenty [17]Septiers of Beans, Pease, _&c._ eleven
thousand three hundred and ninety eight Pounds of Olive-Oyl; thirty
three thousand eight hundred and seventy Measures of Vinegar; ninety six
thousand Quintals of Biscuit; three thousand four hundred and fifty
eight Quintals of Goats Cheese; six thousand five hundred Quintals of
Bacon; one hundred and forty seven thousand Pipes of Wine; twelve
thousand Pipes of Water, _&c._—Provisions in a word they had for six
Months; and so well furnished were they, that Sir _Francis Drake_
observes, in a Letter of his, [18]they had Provisions of Bread and Wine
sufficient to maintain forty thousand Men for a whole Year.

The whole Fleet, in general, is said[19] to have contained thirty two
thousand Persons, and cost every Day thirty thousand Ducats[20].

The General of the Land Forces, and the Commander in Chief in the whole
Expedition, was Don _Alfonso Perez de Guzman_, Duke of _Medina Sidonia_;
and the Admiral was Don _Juan Martinez de Recalde_.

But it was not in _Spain_ only, that such great Preparations were
carrying on, for the Invasion of _England_. For, _Alexander_ Duke of
_Parma_ was also making on his Side prodigious and amazing Preparations,
to assist in this grand Design.

He gathered together out of _Spain_, _France_, _Savoy_, _Italy_,
_Naples_, _Sicily_, _Germany_, and even out of _America_, a very
considerable and choice Army; [21]consisting of about forty thousand
Foot, and three thousand Horse; out of which he selected thirty thousand
Foot, and eighteen hundred Horse, that were to be ready to pass into
_England_. These Troops were quarter’d as follows: [22]Near _Nieuport_
there lay ready thirty Companies of _Italians_; ten of _Walloons_; and
eight of _Scots_, and as many of _Burgundians_: At _Dixmude_ were eighty
Companies of _Netherlanders_; sixty of _Spaniards_; sixty of _Germans_;
and above seven hundred fugitive _English_, _Scots_, and _Irish_, under
the Command of Sir _William Stanley_, and _Charles Nevil_ Earl of
_Westmoreland_. There were moreover four thousand Men posted at
_Corrick_, and nine hundred at _Watene_.

For the Transportation of these Forces, the Duke of _Parma_ prepar’d
Ships at _Nieuport_, _Dunkirk_, _Antwerp_, and other Places; and caused
some new ones to be built with such Expedition, that they seem’d, as
_Strada_ expresses it, [23]to be transform’d in a Moment, from Trees
into Ships.

More particularly: [24]In the River of _Watten_ he caused seventy
flat-bottom’d Boats to be built, each of which could carry thirty
Horses; and to each of them were Bridges fitted for the convenient
Shipping, or Landing of the Horses. There were in most of them, two
Ovens for baking Bread, with a great Quantity of Saddles, Bridles,
Harness, and a good Number of Draught-Horses, to draw the Engines,
Cannons, and other Ammunition, after the _Spaniards_ should be landed.
Of the same Form he had provided two hundred other Vessels at
_Nieuport_, but not so large. And at _Dunkirk_ he had assembled thirty
eight Men of War; for the navigating of which, he had hired Sailors from
_Bremen_, _Hamburgh_, _Emden_, and _Genoa_. In their Ballast he had put
a great Quantity of Beams, or thick Planks, sharpned at the Ends, and
covered with Iron; but full of Clasps and Hooks on the Sides, that they
might be easily joined together. At _Graveling_, he had provided twenty
thousand Casks, which might in a short Time be fastened together with
Nails and Cords, and reduced into the Form of a Bridge. Whatever, in a
Word, was necessary for making Bridges, or for choaking up the Mouths of
Havens and Rivers, was by him got in readiness. And he had even caused a
great Pile of wooden Faggots to be laid near _Nieuport_, for erecting a
Mount or Rampart. Whilst he was thus furnishing himself with all proper
Vessels and other Necessaries, he caused the shallow and sandy Places of
Rivers to be cleared; and had deep Channels cut in proper Places, from
_Ghent_ to _Ysendyck_, _Sluys_, and _Nieuport_, on purpose to convey the
Ships built at _Antwerp_, _Ghent_, _&c._ into the Sea. Finally, he
assembled at _Bruges_ above one hundred Hoys loaden with Provisions,
which he designed to bring into the Ports of _Flanders_, either by the
Way of _Sluys_, or through the forementioned Channels.

The Duke of _Guise_ had also twelve thousand Men on the Coast of
_Normandy_, ready to land in the West of _England_ as soon as the
SPANISH ARMADA had enter’d the Channel[25]; but the _Spaniards_ coming
two Months later than they intended, (or for some other Reasons) the
Duke dismissed his Forces about the End of _June_.

And that this famous Expedition might be supported with spiritual as
well as temporal Weapons[26], Pope _Sixtus_ V created _William Allen_, a
seditious _English_ Priest, Cardinal; and sent him as his Legate into
the _Low-Countries_, with a Bull; wherein, after enumerating the several
Causes of Complaint the See of _Rome_ had against Queen _Elizabeth_,
(namely her suppressing the Catholic Religion, her putting the Queen of
_Scots_ to Death, _&c._) he renewed and confirmed the Sentence of
Excommunication pronounced against her by his Predecessors _Pius_ V and
_Gregory_ XIII, deprived her, as illegitimate, and an Usurper, from all
Princely Dignity, and Dominion over the Kingdoms of _England_ and
_Ireland_; absolved her Subjects from their Allegiance; and strictly
enjoined them, upon Pain of GOD Almighty’s Displeasure, not to lend her
any Help or Assistance, but to join the _Spanish_ Army, and the Duke of
_Parma_’s Forces, as soon as they should be landed: Promising withal a
plenary Indulgence and the Pardon of all their Sins, to as many as would
engage in so laudable an Undertaking.

                  *       *       *       *       *

Such were the extraordinary Preparations made by the _Spaniards_ for
invading _England_. Preparations so great and so dreadful, that all
_Europe_ was alarmed at them. Most Sovereigns expected for some Time,
with the utmost Horror and Astonishment, where the threatening Storm,
which had been so long gathering, would at last fall. But this, though
kept as a great Secret, did not long escape the great Sir _Francis
Walsingham_’s Sagacity. [27]He had Intelligence from _Madrid_, that King
_Philip_ had told his Council, he had dispatched an Express to _Rome_
with a Letter writ with his own Hand to the Pope, acquainting him with
the true Design of his Preparations, and asking his Blessing upon it;
which for some Reasons he would not yet disclose to them, ’till the
Return of the Courier. The Secret being thus lodg’d with the Pope,
_Walsingham_, by the means of a _Venetian_ Priest retain’d at _Rome_ as
his Spy, got a Copy of the original Letter, which was stolen out of the
Pope’s Cabinet by a Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber, who took the Keys out
of the Pope’s Pocket whilst he slept. Upon this Intelligence
_Walsingham_ found a Way to retard the _Spanish_ Invasion for a whole
Year, by getting the _Spanish_ Bills protested at _Genoa_, which should
have supplied them with Money to carry on their Preparations.

Queen _Elizabeth_, it may well be supposed, could not help being
extremely anxious about the issue of the great and dreadful Preparations
that were going on, to deprive her of her Crown and Dignity, and perhaps
of her [28]Life. This inclined her more readily to embrace some
Overtures of Peace, made to her by the _Spaniard_[29]: But it being soon
found out that they were intended only to lull her asleep, and induce
her, by depending upon a Peace, to be careless of her own Defence; and
moreover, _Henry_ III King of _France_ sending her Word, [30]she ought
to stand upon her Guard; she did not therefore rely much on the
Negociations in hand, but took all proper Measures for securing herself,
and protecting her Dominions.

Her Situation was indeed very melancholy, and her Fears well grounded:
For she was without so much as one Ally abroad, except the
_United-Provinces_, which themselves wanted Assistance; and at home she
had a factious and discontented Party, ready to join with the Enemy:
But, by the Assistance of Heaven, by her good Management, and the
sincere Affection of the Generality of her People, she surmounted all
Difficulties, and came off Conqueror.

When she was sure the _Spaniards_ Preparations were design’d against
her, that she might not be taken unprovided, she fitted out as strong a
Fleet as she possibly could; and herein so great was the Diligence of
her Subjects, [31]that though her Preparations were begun but about the
1st of _November_ 1587, yet her Fleet was ready to put to Sea by the
20th of _December_ the same Year.

[32]_Charles_ Lord _Howard_ of _Effingham_, High Admiral of _England_, a
Person of great Prudence and Bravery, was appointed Commander in Chief
of this whole Fleet. His Instructions were, To repair to the Westward,
in conjunction with Sir _Francis Drake_ Vice-Admiral, and Captain _John
Hawkins_, and Captain _Martin Frobisher_ Rear-Admirals: At the same
Time, the Lord _Henry Seymour_, second Son of the late Duke of
_Somerset_, had Orders to lye on the Coast of _Flanders_, with forty
_English_ and _Dutch_ Ships (the latter under the Command of _Justin_ of
_Nassau_, Admiral of _Zealand_) to prevent the Duke of _Parma_’s putting
out to Sea with his Forces.

For Land Service, there were disposed along the Southern Coasts of
_England_ twenty thousand Men. Besides which, two Armies were raised of
choice, well-disciplin’d, and experienced Men; one (under the Command of
_Robert Dudley_ Earl of _Leicester_, consisting of one thousand Horse,
and twenty two thousand Foot,) was encamped at _Tilbury_, near the
_Thames_ Mouth, for the Safeguard of the City of _London_; because it
was given out that the _Spaniards_, after having joined the Duke of
_Parma_, intended to come up the _Thames_, in order to make themselves
Masters of the Metropolis of the Kingdom. The other Army, under the
Command of _Henry Carey_ Lord _Hunsdon_, consisted of thirty four
thousand Foot, and two thousand Horse, and was destined to guard the
Queen’s Person.

_Arthur_ Lord _Grey_, Sir _Francis Knolles_, Sir _John Norris_, Sir
_Richard Bingham_, and Sir _Roger Williams_, Knights, and excellent
Soldiers, were chosen to consult about the best Way of managing the War
at Land. After mature Deliberation, they thought fit that the most
convenient Landing-Places for the Enemy, as well out of _Spain_ as out
of the _Low-Countries_, should be well mann’d and fortify’d, namely
_Milford-Haven_, _Falmouth_, _Plymouth_, _Portland_, the Isle of
_Wight_, _Portsmouth_, the open Coast of _Kent_ called the _Downs_, the
_Thames_ Mouth, _Harwich_, _Yarmouth_, _Hull_, _&c._ that the Train’d
Bands, all along the Maritime Counties, should meet in Arms upon a
Signal given, to defend the said Ports, and do their best to prevent the
Enemy’s landing; and, in Case of their landing, that they should lay all
the Country waste round about, and leave neither Booty nor Forage for
them; that they should annoy them Night and Day with continual Alarms,
so as to give them no Rest; but not venture the Hazard of a Battle,
’till more Commanders with their Companies should come up; of whom one
in every Shire was nominated Chief.

Moreover, the active Queen, in order to quicken the Zeal and Diligence
of her Subjects, especially of those who lay near the Sea-Coasts, caused
Letters to be sent to the chief of them: Wherein, after putting them in
mind of the common and imminent Danger the whole Nation was in, she told
them, that she “expected on this extraordinary Occasion, a larger
Proportion of Furniture, both for Horsemen and Footmen; thereby to be in
their best Strength against any Attempt whatsoever, to be employed,
whether about her own Person, or otherwise. And the Number she required
them to signify to her Privy-Council[33].” She required moreover the
Nobility in the several Counties, to provide themselves, and their
Servants and Dependants in like manner, with Horses and Armour, to be
ready to repair upon Summons to the Queen, for Defence of her Person:
And to this Purpose Letters were address’d to them from the Lords of the
Council, by her Command.

Such were the Directions given. [34]And accordingly Cities, Counties,
Towns, and Villages, the Cinque-Ports, and all other Havens of
_England_, manifested as great Forwardness in their zealous Love and
Duty, as either Subjects could perform, or Prince expect. The City of
_London_, in particular, being requested by the Privy-Council, to find
five thousand Men, and fifteen Ships, they willingly and cheerfully
furnished thirty Ships provided with all Necessaries, and ten thousand
able Men, well armed and trained; besides which, they kept in readiness
thirty thousand Men more, prepared to march wherever there should be
Occasion[35]; and also lent the Queen fifty one thousand nine hundred
Pounds, in ready Money.

Then, as to the rest of the Nation: [36]As soon as it was reported that
the Queen was come near _London_, and the _Spanish_ Fleet appeared in
the Channel, the greatest Part of the Nobility, except those that were
obliged to stay in each County on account of their Offices, repaired to
_London_, to preserve the Queen’s Person; bringing with them goodly
Bands of Horsemen, about five thousand in all, and maintaining them at
their own Charge ’till the _Spanish_ Navy was known to be passed beyond
_Scotland_: These were the Lord Chancellor _Hatton_, the Earls of
_Lincoln_, _Warwick_, _Leicester_, _Essex_, _Worcester_, and _Hereford_;
the Lord Viscount _Montacute_; the Lords _Burghley_, _Compton_,
_Morley_, _Rich_, _Dacres_, _Windsor_, _Audley_, _Sandes_, _Mordaunt_,
_Lumley_, _Mountjoy_, _Stourton_, and _Darcy_.

In a Word, all Persons throughout _England_ in general, unanimously
concurred to be ready to serve for the Defence of the Queen and
Kingdom[37]: In this there was no Difference between the Catholic and
the Protestant, but herein appeared a perfect Sympathy, Concourse, and
Consent of all Sorts of Persons, without respect of Religion. By this
hearty Zeal, seconded with suitable Endeavours, it came to pass, that
some Counties were able to bring into the Field twenty thousand, and
others even forty thousand able fighting Men: The Maritime Counties, in
particular, on the South and East of _England_, from _Cornwall_ to
_Lincolnshire_, were so well furnished with a stout and well regulated
Militia, that there was no Place for landing foreign Forces, but within
eight and forty Hours there could resort to that Place above twenty
thousand fighting Men, with Ordnance and other suitable Provisions.

And that the Popish discontented Party at home might neither join the
Enemy, nor favour their Descent, the Queen caused the most obnoxious of
them to be imprisoned in _Wisbich-Castle_ in the Isle of _Ely_.

She also directed [38]Sir _William Fitz-Williams_, Lord Deputy of
_Ireland_, what to do, in case the Enemy should land in any Part of his
Government, and pointed out to him what Precautions he should use to
hinder the _Irish_ from rising.

There remained only the King of _Scots_, of whom Queen _Elizabeth_ had
most Reason to be afraid; since she had newly given him an unpardonable
Provocation, namely, in causing his Mother to be publickly beheaded, who
was a Sovereign Princess, independent of her. This was sufficient to
dispose him, out of a Principle of Revenge, to favour the Descent of the
_Spaniards_ in one Extremity of the Kingdom, by making a Diversion in
the other. With that View he had been tampered with by the Duke of
_Parma_, and had received from him Offers of Assistance[39]: But the
politic Queen so effectually caress’d him, made him such advantageous
Proposals, and so plainly convinc’d him, that the Loss of _England_
would not fail of being attended with that of _Scotland_[40]; that he,
sensible of the common Danger wherewith he was threatened, declar’d the
_Spaniards_ Enemies, and made Preparations against them with great
Chearfulness and Alacrity: [41]Giving a strict Charge upon all the
Sea-Coasts, that the _Spaniards_ should not be suffered to land in any
Part, but that the _English_ might land, and be reliev’d of any Wants:
[42]He moreover offer’d Queen _Elizabeth_ his Forces, his Person, and
all that he could command, to be employed against the common Enemy: And
he humourously observ’d upon this Occasion[43], _That he look’d for no
other Favour from the Spaniards, than what_ Polyphemus _promis’d_
Ulysses, _that he should be reserv’d for the last Morsel_.

BOTH Sides being thus fitted out, and prepared for Action, let us now
proceed,

_Thirdly_, To give an Account of the Expedition, and the several
Engagements between the two Fleets, with the final Event of the whole.

The King of _Spain_’s Instructions to his General, were[46], To repair
to _Calais_ Road, and there wait for the Arrival of the Duke of _Parma_,
who had Orders to join him with his Fleet and Forces; and, upon their
meeting, to open a Letter directed to them both, with further Orders
[particularly, to advance up the _Thames_, and attack _London_.] He was
strictly enjoined, in the mean time, to sail along the Coasts of
_Bretagne_ and _Normandy_, in order to avoid being discovered by the
_English_ Fleet; and if unexpectedly he should meet them, not to offer
Battle, but act only upon the Defensive.

With these Instructions, the _Spanish_ Fleet set sail on the 19th of
_May_ from the _Tagus_, and steer’d for the _Groyne_, the Place of
general Rendezvous. But they had not been long at Sea, before they were
so dispersed by a violent Storm, off of Cape _Finisterre_, that scarce
the third Part of them reached, some Days after, the intended Port: And
three of the Gallies, by the Stratagem of _David Gwyn_, an _English_
Slave, assisted by some of the _Moorish_ Rowers, were run into a Harbour
of _France_[47].

In the mean time, the Lord _Howard_ having continued a good while upon
the Narrow Seas between _England_ and _Flanders_[48], sent Sir _Francis
Drake_ towards the Western Coasts, with about fifty Sail, great and
small; intending to follow himself, with a stronger Force, if there
should be Occasion. For the present he remained in the _Downs_, with the
Lord _Henry Seymour_ his Vice-Admiral, where they had under their
Command twenty Ships belonging to the City of _London_, with several
other Vessels fitted out by the Coast-Towns, from the _Thames_ to
_Newcastle_. But News being brought of the Armada’s being ready to put
to Sea, the Admiral left the Lord _Henry Seymour_ with a convenient
Number of Ships, to watch the Duke of _Parma_’s Motions; and setting
Sail on the 21st of _May_, with about thirty Vessels of all Sorts,
arrived on the 23d at _Plymouth_. Here he was joined by Sir _Francis
Drake_, whom he constituted his Vice-Admiral, and whose Squadron, by the
Addition of some Vessels from the Western Ports, amounted now to sixty
Sail.

The Lord _Howard_, upon his Arrival at _Plymouth_, gave Orders for the
Victualling, and putting in Readiness, the whole Fleet, which now
consisted in all of about ninety Ships and Barks. As soon as it was
ready he put out to Sea, and cruized at the Channel’s Mouth, between
_Ushent_ and _Scilly_, looking out for the _Spanish_ Fleet. He thus
continued cruizing for several Days, sometimes upon the Coast of
_France_, and sometimes upon that of _England_; and, at last, hearing
nothing of the _Spaniards_, returned to _Plymouth_, for a new Supply of
Victuals, and other Necessaries.

Mean while, fourteen _Spanish_ Ships were discovered between _Ushent_
and _Scilly_, which were afterwards known to have been separated from
the rest of the Fleet by the late Storm. But before they could be met
with by any _English_ Ships, they had a Northerly Wind, which carried
them back to the _Groyne_; where, and at the neighbouring Ports, the
whole Fleet took in their Soldiers and Warlike Provisions.

The _Spanish_ Fleet, as has been said above, had been dispersed, and
somewhat disabled by a violent Storm. This had like to have proved more
fatal to the _English_ than to the _Spaniards_ themselves[49]. For it
being reported all over _Europe_, that the whole _Spanish_ Fleet was
destroyed, Queen _Elizabeth_ and her Ministers thought that it was at
least so damaged, as that it could not proceed ’till the next Year.
Relying therefore upon this Intelligence, which they took for certain,
Secretary _Walsingham_ signified the Queen’s Pleasure to the Lord
High-Admiral, to send back four of his largest Ships into Port. His
Lordship had, in the mean time, likewise Intelligences sundry ways, that
the Enemy’s Fleet was dispersed into several Ports of _Spain_,
distressed, spoiled, in want of Provisions, and with a great Mortality
among the Men. This, however, happened to be only a false Rumour. The
Lord-Admiral not thinking it safe to depend upon such Uncertainties,
when the Nation’s All was at Stake, got the Order countermanded;
alledging how dangerous it was to be too credulous in a matter of such
Importance, and that he would rather keep the Ships out at his own
Charge, than hazard his Country’s Safety. But, in order to be fully
satisfied, (as he was sure that the Coasts of _England_ and _France_,
which he had examined, were clear) he thought proper[50], with the
Advice of a Council of War, to take the Opportunity of the first
Northerly Wind, and go in quest of the _Spanish_ Fleet, in the _Groyne_,
and other Ports of _Gallicia_; and there utterly destroy it, if it were
already so disabled as was reported; or, if otherwise, to get certain
Intelligence concerning its true State and Condition. Accordingly his
Lordship made Sail for the Coast of _Spain_, with a Northerly Wind, and
held the same Course for about three Days, from the 8th to the 10th of
_July_. He was not then above forty Leagues from that Kingdom, when
being informed that the Enemy’s Fleet was not so much damaged as
reported, and the Wind coming to be Southerly, he judged it best (as his
Instructions were to guard the _English_ Coasts,) to return to
_Plymouth_; lest the same Wind should bring the Enemies out, and carry
them by him, unseen, towards _England_. He arrived at _Plymouth_ the
12th of _July_, and with great Expedition supplied his Fleet with
whatever Necessaries were wanting.

His Caution was indeed very seasonable: For with the same Southerly Wind
the Duke of _Medina Sidonia_ sailed, with the whole Fleet under his
Command, from the _Groyne_, on the 12th of _July_, (the very same Day
the Lord Admiral arrived at _Plymouth_,) and in two or three Days
detached a Yatch to the Duke of _Parma_, with Notice of his being
advanced so far. He pressed him at the same Time, to be ready with the
Troops and Ships he was directed to provide, in order to pass over into
_England_ under his Convoy, as soon as he should be arrived in the
Streights of _Dover_.

While the _Spanish_ Fleet lay at the _Groyne_[51], an _English_
Fisherman that was taken and brought to that Place, gave the Enemies,
either out of Ignorance or Design, this false Account: “That the
_English_ Fleet had lately been at Sea; but seeing no Prospect of the
_Spaniards_ pursuing their Design that Year, was returned, and the
greater Part of the Men belonging to the Ships discharged.” This false
Intelligence made the Duke of _Medina Sidonia_ deviate from his
Instructions; and as he vainly supposed that he could easily surprise
our Fleet, and burn or otherwise destroy it, he resolved not to lose so
glorious an Opportunity. Instead therefore of going directly to join the
Duke of _Parma_, a Resolution was taken in the _Spanish_ Fleet, to bend
their Course towards _England_.

[52]On the 16th of _July_ there was a Calm and a thick Fog ’till Noon.
Then the North East Wind blew very strong, and presently after the West
Wind ’till Midnight; and then the East-South-East Wind; insomuch that
the _Spanish_ Fleet being thereby dispersed, was hardly joined again
’till it came within Sight of _England_. At length this Fleet, after an
indifferent Passage over the Bay of _Biscay_, arrived _July_ 19, in
Sight of _England_ and entered the Channel. The first Land they made was
the _Lizard_, which they took to be the _Ram’s Head_ near _Plymouth_;
but Night approaching, they stood off, designing the next Morning to
attack the _English_ Ships in _Plymouth_ Harbour.

The same Day[53], the Lord Admiral was informed by Captain _Thomas
Flemming_, Commander of the _Golden Hind_ Pinnace, who had been left in
the Channel for Discovery, that [Sidenote: PLATE 1.] the _Spanish_ Fleet
was seen near the _Lizard_, the Wind being then Southerly, or
South-West. Tho’ the Wind blew hard into _Plymouth-Sound_, and the
Intelligence was not received ’till about four o’ Clock in the
Afternoon, yet his Lordship, with much Diligence and Industry, got out
the same Evening with six of his Ships, and anchored with them alone the
whole Night, without the Harbour.

[54]The next Day, _July_ 20, the Lord High-Admiral, accompanied with
fifty four Ships of his Fleet, that had plied out of the _Sound_,
notwithstanding the South-West Wind, advanced towards the Enemy. They
were scarce got as far as the _Eddystone_, when they discovered, about
Noon, the _Spanish_ Fleet to the [Sidenote: PLATE 2.]Westward, opposite
to _Fowey_, in form of a half Moon (the Points whereof were about seven
Miles asunder) coming slowly up the Channel, tho’ with full Sails. The
_English_ suffered them to pass by unmolested, that they might chace
them in the rear, with all the Advantage of the Wind.

The next Morning, _July_ 21, all the _English_ Ships being then come out
of _Plymouth_, and in number near a hundred, had recovered the Wind of
the _Spaniards_[55], two Leagues to the Westward of _Eddystone_. About
Nine o’ Clock, the Lord-Admiral sent his Pinnace, named the
_Defiance_[56], to denounce War against the Enemy, by the Discharge of
all her Guns. He himself immediately seconded her from his own Ship, the
_Ark-Royal_, by thundering furiously on one of the Enemy’s, commanded by
_Alphonso de Leva_, which he mistook for the _St. Martin_, the Admiral’s
Ship; but she was, after a smart Engagement, [Sidenote: PLATE 3.]rescued
by the _Spaniards_. In the mean time, Sir _Francis Drake_, Captain _John
Hawkins_, and Captain _Martin Forbisher_, vigorously engaged the Enemy’s
sternmost Ships, under the Conduit of their Vice-Admiral _Recalde_; in
one of which _Recalde_ himself was supposed to be. He did all that a
gallant Officer could do to keep his Ships together; but the Fight was
so briskly maintained, that, notwithstanding all his Endeavours, they
were forced to retreat to the main Body of the Fleet; and at length, his
own Ship being very much damaged with Shot, and grown unserviceable, he
retired thither himself, tho’ with much ado.

In this first Engagement _Recalde_’s Ship lost fifteen Men[57].

At the same time, the Duke of _Medina_ gathered together his Fleet[58],
which was dispersed about; and hoisting more Sail, held on his Course
with all the Speed he could make. Nor was it in his Power to do
otherwise, seeing the Wind favoured the _English_, and their Ships were
so light and nimble, that they would charge, wind, and tack about with
incredible Swiftness; whereas the _Spanish_ great and heavy Slugs, stood
like so many Butts for the _English_ Shot. Although the _Spaniards_ were
so briskly charged by the _English_, they made a running Fight of it;
and, after a smart Engagement of two Hours, the Lord High-Admiral
thought fit to desist, because forty of his Ships were not yet come up,
being scarce got out of _Plymouth_ Haven[59]. So not proceeding any
farther, he gave the Signal for a Council of War;——Wherein his
Lordship’s prudent and considerate Advice being very much approved,
Orders were delivered to each Captain, in what manner they should pursue
the Enemy.

The Night following, one of the _Spanish_ Ships, called the _St.
Katherine_, having received much Damage in the Fight, was brought into
the midst of their Fleet, to be repaired[60]. And a large _Biscayan_
Ship of eight hundred Tuns, belonging to _Michael de Oquendo_, Admiral
of the _Guypuscoan_ Squadron, on board of which was the Treasurer of the
Fleet, was designedly set on Fire by a _Dutch_ Gunner, who had been ill
used[61]; but the _Spaniards_ took out the best Part of the Money, when
they saw the Ship in Danger; and after her upper Part was burnt and
blown up, the Flame was extinguished by some Ships that came seasonably
to her Assistance. But one of them, a great Galleon, commanded by Don
_Pedro de Valdez_, sprung her Foremast and Boltsprit, by falling foul of
another Vessel in the Hurry and Confusion; and so, not being able to
keep Company with the rest of the Fleet, was left behind. The Night
being extremely dark, and the Sea running so high, that no Succour could
come to her, she fell the next Day, _July_ 22, into the Hands of
[Sidenote: PLATE 4.]Sir _Francis Drake_; who had her conducted to
_Dartmouth_, and sent the Captain, and some other Gentlemen who were on
board, Prisoners to _Plymouth_, where they remained eighteen Months,
’till their Ransoms were paid. In this Galleon was found fifty five
thousand Ducats of Gold, which _Drake_’s Men shared amongst themselves.

[62]This Night the _Spanish_ Fleet bore along by the _Start_, and the
next Morning was as far to the Leward as the _Berry_[63]. Sir _Francis
Drake_ had been ordered to carry Lights; but being in full Chace of some
_German_ Hulks, or Merchant-Men, which he discovered late in the
Evening, and took for Enemies, he happened to neglect it; which
occasioned most of the Fleet to lye by all Night, because not seeing the
Lights, they knew not whom to follow. For that Reason, Sir _Francis_,
and the rest of the Fleet, did not come up ’till the next Evening with
the Lord Admiral; who, accompanied only with the _Bear_ and the _Mary
Rose_, had pursued the Enemy, within Culverin Shot, all the foregoing
Night. [64]Thro’ this Mistake, the rest of the _English_ Fleet staid so
far behind, that the next Morning the nearest could scarce be seen half
Mast high, and very many were quite out of Sight.

_July_ 22. This whole Day the _Spanish_ Admiral spent in disposing his
Fleet in the best Order he could think of. [65]He commanded _Alphonso de
Leva_ to bring the first and the last Squadron together; and assigning
every particular Ship its proper Station in Battle, according to the
Plan agreed on in _Spain_, enjoined their respective Commanders to keep
the same on Pain of Death. He also dispatch’d _Glich_, an Ensign, to the
Prince of _Parma_, to advise him of his near Approach, and inform him of
the State of the Navy. In the mean time, the forementioned Ship of
_Oquendo_ having been much damaged by the Fire, the _Spanish_ Admiral
ordered, after the Officers, Men, and Money were removed into another
Vessel, [Sidenote: PLATE 5.]that she should be abandoned, and set
adrift[66]. Whereupon, the Lord High-Admiral sent the Lord _Thomas
Howard_, and Captain _Hawkins_ in a small Skiff on board her, who found
her in a very pitiful Condition. Her Decks were fallen in, the Steerage
broken, the Stern blown out, and about fifty poor Creatures burnt with
Powder in a most miserable manner. The Stench, as well as the horrible
Spectacle, soon made them return to the Lord-Admiral; who ordered the
Bark _Fleming_ to conduct her into some Port, and accordingly she was
brought the next Day into _Weymouth_.

The Night following prov’d very calm; during which, the four Galleasses
of _Naples_ singling themselves from the rest of the Enemy’s Fleet, gave
Reason to suspect that they had a Design to distress some of the small
_English_ Vessels, which were short of the Fleet; but their Courage
failing them, they attempted nothing.

On the 23d the Wind turning to the North-East, the _Spaniards_ took the
Advantage of it; and when they came over against _Portland_, tacked
about upon the _English_, who presently tacked likewise, and stood in to
the North-West, towards the Shore, as did the _Spaniards_ also. But that
Course not being good for the _English_ to recover the Wind of the
_Spaniards_, the former cast about to the Eastward. And, after several
Attempts on both Sides to get the Weather-gage, the _Spaniards_ offering
to board the _English_, a smart Engagement began, which was managed with
Confusion enough, and with Variety of Success. The Enemy seeing several
of the _English_ Ships waited their coming, particularly the _Ark_, the
_Nonpareil_, the _Elizabeth-Jonas_, the _Victory_, _&c._ they fell a
stern the _Nonpareil_, which was the hindmost Ship; and in the mean
time, the _Triumph_, with the _Merchant-Royal_, the _Centurion_, the
_Margaret_ and _John_, the _Mary-Rose_, and the _Golden-Lion_, were so
far to the Leeward, and at such a Distance from the rest of the Fleet,
that the Galleasses took Courage, and bearing down upon them, attacked
them very vigorously; but they gave them a warm Reception for an Hour
and a half, ’till some of her Majesty’s Ships came to their Relief.

The Wind then shifted to the South-East, and afterwards to the
South-South-West; [Sidenote: PLATE 6.]whereupon a Body of _English_
Ships, and several Merchant-Men attacked the _Spanish_ Fleet so sharply
to the Westward, that it was all forced to give way. The Lord-Admiral
perceiving this, and observing at the same Time the Distress which the
_Triumph_ and the five Ships above mentioned in her Company, were in, he
ordered some Ships that were then near at hand, to follow him, and to
set upon the _Spaniards_ a-fresh; and he strictly charged them, to go
within Musket-Shot of the Enemy, before they discharged any one Piece of
Ordnance, that they might have a better Mark, and more effectually
succour the _Triumph_. This was immediately performed by the _Ark_, the
_Elizabeth-Jonas_, the Galleon of _Leicester_, the _Golden Lion_, the
_Victory_, the _Mary Rose_, the _Dreadnought_, and the _Swallow_; for in
that order they proceeded. The Duke of _Medina_ perceiving their Design,
came out with sixteen of his best Galleons, to intercept the Lord
Admiral, and stop him from assisting the _Triumph_. But, after a very
sharp Conflict, the _Spaniards_ were forced to give way, and for their
greater Safety to gather themselves close into a Roundel, their best and
largest Ships standing outermost, and fencing the lesser and the most
battered. In this Conflict, _William Coxe_, Captain of a small Pinnace
of Sir _William Winter_’s, nam’d the _Delight_, was slain by a great
Shot, while he was bravely fighting against the Enemy.

Towards the Evening, four or five of the _Spanish_ Vessels edged out of
the South-Westward, where they were met by some of our Ships; amongst
which, the _May-Flower of London_ valiantly discharged some Pieces of
Cannon at them; and, on this and other Occasions, that Ship’s Company
behaved with great Resolution and Courage.

Thus the Fight continued from Morning till Night, being managed with
great Bravery; but the _Spaniards_ Shot flew, for the most part, over
the Heads of the _English_, without doing Execution[67]; the reason of
which was, that the _English_ Ships being far less than the Enemy’s,
made the Attack with more Quickness and Agility; and when they had given
a Broad-Side, sheer’d off to a convenient Distance; and levell’d their
Shot so directly at the larger and more unwieldy Ships of the
_Spaniards_, as seldom to miss their Aim. Some advis’d the Lord-Admiral,
with more Heat than Discretion, to grapple with and board them; but he
thought it neither safe nor convenient; because the Enemy’s Fleet had a
considerable Army on board, whereas ours had no such Advantage; besides
their Ships far exceeded the _English_ in Number and Bulk, and were much
stronger and higher built; insomuch that their Men having the
Opportunity to ply the others from such lofty Decks, must inevitably
have destroyed those that were obliged, as it were, to fight beneath
them. And he foresaw likewise, that the Damage and Disgrace of a total
Defeat would much outweigh the Advantage of a Victory, should he happen
to obtain it; since, if he was vanquished, it would have much endangered
the Safety of the whole Kingdom; but if he got the better, he could
obtain no more than the naked Credit of putting a Fleet in Disorder, and
baffling an Enemy.——In this Day’s Engagement, a great _Venetian_ Ship,
with several other smaller ones were taken by the _English_[68].

On the 24th of _July_, there was but little done[69]; the Fight being
only between four great Galleasses and some _English_ Vessels[70]. The
_Spaniards_, upon this Occasion had great Advantage, since their Ships
had Oars, and ours, by reason of a Calm, had no use of their Sails.
However, the _English_ galled the Enemy very much with their Cannon and
Chain-Shot; but at last, wanting Powder and other Necessaries to
continue the Fight, the Lord Admiral sent some Vessels into the next
Port for a Supply. In the mean time, a Council of War was held, wherein
it was agreed, That the Fleet should be divided into four Squadrons, to
be commanded, the first by the Lord Admiral himself in the _Ark-Royal_;
the second by Sir _Francis Drake_ in the _Revenge_; the third by Captain
_Hawkins_; and the fourth by Captain _Forbisher_. [71]This Afternoon,
his Lordship gave order, that in the Night, six Merchant-Ships out of
every Squadron (as being the lightest) should set upon the _Spanish_
Fleet in several Places at once; but it being calm all that Night,
nothing could be done.

The next Morning, _July 25_, both [Sidenote: PLATE 7.]Fleets being come
over against the Isle of _Wight_, (which the _Spaniards_ had resolved to
make themselves Masters of,) and not above a hundred Yards asunder, a
terrible Fight began[72]. The _St. Ann_, a large _Portuguese_ Galleon,
being short of the rest to the Southward, because not able to keep up
with them, was attack’d by some of Captain _Hawkins_’s Squadron, which
stood next to it; who causing themselves to be towed along, attempted to
board her, and went so close, that their Boats were beaten off with
Musket-Shot: _Leva_ and Don _Diego Telles Enriques_ perceiving the
Galleon’s Danger, issued out of the _Spanish_ Fleet with three
Galleasses, and endeavoured to rescue her; but they were so warmly
received by the Lord Admiral himself, and the Lord _Thomas Howard_ in
the _Golden Lion_, who, by reason of the Calm, had their Ships tow’d
along with Boats, that the Galleon was got off with much Difficulty, and
not without Loss; for one of the Galleasses was forc’d to be carried
away upon the Careen; another, by a Shot from the _Ark_, lost her
Lanthorn; and the third her Peak-head. Thus many Shots were interchanged
between the _Ark_ and _Lion_ and the Galleasses, in Sight of both
Fleets, which looked on, and could not come near by reason of the Calm.
At length it began to blow a small Gale, whereupon the _Spanish_ Fleet
edged up to succour their Galleasses, and so rescued them; but so
roughly were the Galleasses handled, that after this none of them would
venture upon any new Engagement.

[73]Then the Fleets drawing near one another the Fight was renewed; but
it did not continue long; except that the _Nonpareil_ and the _Mary
Rose_ were for some time engaged with the Enemy, and striking their
Topsails, lay a while by, and braved the whole Fleet of _Spain_. In the
mean while, the _Triumph_, to the Northward of the _Spanish_ Fleet, was
so far to Leward, that being apprehensive some of the Enemy might
weather her, she towed off with the Help of several Boats, and so
recovered the Wind. The _Bear_ and the _Elizabeth Jonas_ perceiving her
in Distress, bore down to rescue her, and by their Boldness put
themselves into the like Danger; but they, however, made their party
good, ’till they had recovered the Wind. And thus ended this Day’s
Fight, which was very sharp for the time.

[74]The _Spaniards_ gave a different Account of this Day’s Engagement;
for they said that the _English_ did miserably batter, with their great
Guns, the _Spanish_ Admiral, who lay in the rear; came so near him as to
kill many of his Men; brought his Mainmast by the board; and he was in
great Danger of being lost, had not _Mexia_ and _Recalde_ come timely to
his Assistance; but that, after this, the _Spanish_ Admiral and his Men,
seconded by _Recalde_, and others, set upon the _English_ Admiral, who
by the turning of the Wind happily escaped; that the _Spaniards_ from
that time gave over the Chace, and keeping on their Course, dispatch’d a
Messenger to the Duke of _Parma_, to desire him to come and join the
Armada with his own Squadron as soon as possible; and to send them
withal some great Shot for the use of the main Fleet.

[75]However it be, the _English_ had so battered the Enemy in the last
Conflict, that the latter had Recourse to the Form of a Roundel for
their better Security.

[76]On _Friday, July 26_, the Lord High-Admiral sent for the Lord
_Thomas Howard_ the Lord _Sheffield_, _Roger Townshend_, Captain _Martin
Forbisher_, Captain _John Hawkins_, on board his own Ship the _Ark_; and
there confer’d on them the Honour of Knighthood, as well for a Reward of
their good Services in the late Engagement, as for an Encouragement to
the rest of the Officers.

[77]Next, a Council of War being held, it was determined, as our Ships
began to want Powder and Shot, that they should not attack the
_Spaniards_ again ’till they came to the Streights of _Calais_; because
they would there be joined and reinforced by the Squadron under the
Command of the Lord _Henry Seymour_ and Sir _William Winter_, stationed
in those Parts to block up the Duke of _Parma_; and might, at the same
time, receive a plentiful Store of Ammunition from our Coasts.

[78]So the _Spanish_ Fleet sailed forward, [Sidenote: PLATE 8.]this and
the best part of the next Day, with a gentle Gale at South-West and by
South, the _English_ following them close, and driving them like Sheep
before them; and so far was this Invincible Armada from alarming the
Sea-Coasts with any frightful Apprehensions, that a great many of the
young Nobility and Gentry entered themselves Volunteers, and taking
leave of their Parents, Wives, and Children, did, with incredible
Chearfulness, hire Ships at their own Charge; and, in pure Love to their
Country, joined the Grand Fleet in vast numbers: [79]Among which were,
the Earls of _Oxford_, _Northumberland_, and _Cumberland_; the Lord
_Dudley_; Sir _Thomas_, Sir _Robert_, and _William Cecil_; Sir _Henry
Brooke_, Sir _William Hatton_, Sir _Charles Blount_, Sir _Walter
Raleigh_, Sir _Robert Carey_, Sir _Ambrose Willoughby_, Sir _Thomas
Vavasor_, Sir _Horatio Pallavicini_; _Thomas Gerard_, _Henry Nowel_,
_Edward Darcy_, _Thomas Woodhouse_, _William Harvey_, _Arthur Gorges_,
and others; [80]and at the same time, the Justices of Peace in the
maritime Counties, as also the Earl of _Sussex_, Sir _George Carey_, and
the Captains of the Forts and Castles along the Sea-Coasts, sent Ships,
Men, Powder, Shot, Victuals, and all kinds of Provisions, for the Relief
and Assistance of the main Fleet.

[81]_July 27._ This Day, towards the Evening, the _Spanish_ Fleet came
to an Anchor before _Calais_; [82]intending for _Dunkirk_, where they
were to join the Prince of _Parma_’s Forces; [83]but their Pilots having
told them, that, if they ventured any farther, they should be in danger
of being carried away by the Force of the Tide into the Northern
Channel, for that Reason they proceeded no farther than _Calais_; the
_English_, on their part, followed them close, and anchored within
Culverin-Shot of them; and, by the accession of the Ships under the Lord
_Henry Seymour_ and Sir _William Winter_, consisted now of a hundred and
forty Sail, all stout Ships, and nimble and good Sailors; tho’ the main
Brunt of the Engagement lay but upon fifteen or sixteen of them.

The _Spaniards_ now sent several Messengers, one after another, to the
Duke of _Parma_, to press and importune him to send out forty Fly-Boats
to their Assistance; without which, by reason of the Unwieldiness of
their Ships, they could not, as they said, engage the light and active
Vessels of the _English_; they entreated him likewise, with great
Earnestness, to use all Speed in embarking his Army, and be ready to
take the first Opportunity, under their Protection, of landing in
_England_; but it seems he was not ready, and so could not answer their
Summons; his flat-bottom’d Boats were all leaky, his Provisions not yet
all brought in, and his Sailors, who had been hitherto kept together
against their Wills, had deserted in great numbers; besides, thirty five
Men of War belonging to _Holland_ and _Zealand_, commanded by Count
_Justin de Nassau_, continued to block up the very Mouth of the Harbours
of _Dunkirk_ and _Nieuport_, from whence alone he could put to Sea; and
so well were they furnished with great Guns and small Arms, that he
could not possibly put from Shore, without running a very great and
manifest Danger; however, intending as soon as he conveniently could, to
join the _Spanish_ Fleet, he sent a Pinnace to inform the Duke of
_Medina_, “[84]That he could not be ready for them ’till the _Friday_
following, _September 4_;” but the _Spanish_ Fleet was forced to depart
before that time, in the utmost Hurry and Confusion.

[85]For, on _July 28_, the next Day [Sidenote: PLATE 9.]after their
coming to an Anchor, the Lord Admiral, by the Queen’s express Command
and Direction, singled out eight of his worst Ships; bestowed upon them
good Plenty of Pitch, Tar, Rosin, and Wildfire; lined them well with
Brimstone and other combustible Matter; and loaded all their Cannon with
Bullets, Chains, and the like destructive Instruments; thus equip’d, he
sent them with the Wind and Tide, about two o’ Clock in the Morning,
into the midst of the _Spanish_ Fleet, under the Conduct of —— _Young_
and —— _Prowse_; who when they were come within Cannon-Shot, set Fire to
the Trains, and then retired. The Approach of these Fire-Ships, and the
dreadful Blaze which the Fire made all the Sea over, was no sooner
perceived by the _Spaniards_, but it put their whole Fleet into the
utmost Consternation. Many of the Soldiers on board had been at the
Siege of _Antwerp_[86], and seen the destructive Machines made use of
there: Suspecting therefore that these were big with other Engines of
Slaughter, besides the destructive Element that show’d itself without,
they began to raise a most hideous Clamour of, _Cut your Cables, or get
up your Anchors_; [87]and in a panic Fright put to Sea with all the
Confusion and Precipitancy imaginable.

[88]The _Spaniards_ reported, however, That their Admiral, upon the
Approach of the Fire-Ships, made the Signal for weighing Anchor, and
standing out to Sea; and ordered that each Ship, after the Danger was
over, should return to her Station; that he did return himself, and
fired a Gun as a Signal for the rest to do the like; but the Report
thereof was heard but by few; because their Fears had so dispersed them,
that some were got a considerable way out to Sea, and others among the
Shoals on the Coast of _Flanders_.

However it was, the _Spanish_ Fleet being by this successful Stratagem
thus driven from their Station in _Calais-Road_[89], another very sharp
Engagement began the next Morning about Eight o’ Clock, _July 29_, and
continued eight Hours. The chief Galleass, commanded by _Hugo de
Moncada_, having in the last Night’s Confusion lost her Rudder, by
falling foul of another Ship’s Cable, and floated up and down for some
time before the Wind, endeavoured to save herself by rowing into
[Sidenote: PLATE 10.]_Calais_ Harbour; which the Lord Admiral
perceiving, he dispatch’d Mr. _Amias Preston_, one of his Lieutenants,
into his Long-Boat, with Mr. _Thomas Gerrard_, Mr. _William Hervey_, and
others, to take her; she did not however surrender ’till after a sharp
and doubtful Dispute, wherein _Hugo de Moncada_ was killed, by a Shot in
the Head; and the Soldiers and Rowers to the number of four hundred,
either drowned or put to the Sword: [90]The Ship and Guns, after the
_English_ had freed three hundred Galley-Slaves which were on board, and
taken out fifty thousand Ducats of Gold, of the King of _Spain_’s Money,
fell, as a Wreck to Monsieur _Gourden_, Governor of _Calais_[91].

[92]In the taking of this Galleass, Mr. _Gerard_ and Mr. _Harvey_
signalized themselves; for they entered it only with their Swords; a
thing then commonly spoken of with Admiration, the like having never
been hazarded before, considering the Height of this Galleass compar’d
to a Ship’s Boat.

[93]The rest of the _Spaniards_ in the mean time, managed their Fleet as
well as they could, and stood over against _Graveling_, where the
_English_ once more getting the Weather-Gage of them, deprived them of
the Conveniency of _Calais-Road_, and kept them from receiving any
Supplies from _Dunkirk_.

[94]Whilst the Lord Admiral was employed in taking the forementioned
Galleass, Sir _Francis Drake_ in the _Revenge_, with Mr. _Thomas Fennar_
in the _Nonpareil_, and the rest of his Squadron, warmly engaged the
_Spanish_ Fleet; soon after Sir _John Hawkins_ in the _Victory_,
accompanied with Mr. _Edward Fenton_ in the _Mary Rose_, Sir _George
Beeston_ in the _Dreadnought_, Mr. _Richard Hawkins_ in the _Swallow_,
and the rest of that Squadron; together with Sir _Robert Southwell_ in
the _Elizabeth-Jonas_, and Mr. _Robert Cross_ in the _Hope_; bearing up
with the Middle of the _Spanish_ Fleet, there continued all that
Forenoon a furious Engagement, wherein Sir _George Beeston_ behaved
himself very valiantly; they were in the mean time seconded by the Lord
Admiral, the Lord _Thomas Howard_, and the Lord _Sheffield_, who also
acquitted themselves very bravely: Astern of these a great Galleon was
attack’d by the Earl of _Cumberland_ and Mr. _George Ryman_ in the
_Bonaventure_, and was likewise battered by the Lord _Henry Seymour_ in
the _Rainbow_, and Sir _William Winter_ in the _Vanguard_; and tho’ she
then recovered the Fleet, yet she sunk the Night following.

[95]On the other hand, the Duke of _Medina_, with the rest of the
_Spanish_ Captains, as _Leva_, _Oquendo_, _Recalde_, _&c._ having with
much ado got clear of the Shallows, were forced to stand the Brunt of
the _English_ Fire, ’till they were miserably torn, and in several
Places shot through; [96]and a great Galleon of _Biscay_, of five
hundred Tuns, with two Saicks, were sunk. The Galleon _St. Matthew_, of
eight hundred Tuns, commanded by Don _Diego de Piementelli_, coming to
the Assistance of Don _Francisco de Toledo_, in the _St. Philip_,
another Galleon of seven hundred Tuns, they were both miserably
shattered by the Lord _Henry Seymour_ and Sir _William Winter_; [97]and
being driven on the Coast of _Ostend_, were likewise there roughly
handled by the _Zealanders_; but _Piementelli_ refusing to leave his
Ship, (though the Duke of _Medina_ sent him his own,) did all he could
to disengage himself; and therefore making towards the Coast of
_Flanders_, he was there again attacked by five _Dutch_ Men of War, and
forc’d at last to strike to _Peter Dousa_[98], one of the _Dutch_
Captains, who carried him into _Zealand_ and, for a Trophy of his
Victory, hung his Flag in the Church of _Leyden_, which reach’d from the
top of it to the bottom; [99]during which, a _Castilian_ Ship of four
hundred Tuns, was cast away on the _Flemish_ Coast. The _St. Philip_,
after having been driven almost as far as _Ostend_, where her Commander
left her because she proved extremely leaky, was seized by some Ships of
_Flushing_.

Thus did the Fight continue for the best part of this whole Day; during
which the _Spanish_ Fleet was closely pursued, extremely battered, and
reduced to the utmost Distress[100]. The _English_ Commanders in
general, shewed on all Occasions great Resolution and Bravery; and in
this last Action, the Earl of _Cumberland_, the Lords _Henry Seymour_,
_Thomas Howard_, and _Edmund Sheffield_; Sir _William Winter_, Sir
_Robert Southwell_, Sir _George Beeston_, Sir _John Hawkins_; and the
Captains _Edward Fenton_, _Richard Hawkins_, _George Ryman_, and
[101]_Robert Cross_ signalized themselves in a remarkable manner; the
latter, in particular, sunk the great Galleon of _Biscay_ above
mentioned, and two other Vessels. As for the _Spaniards_, though some of
them performed their Duty, and fought with great Bravery, yet, in
general, they acted but faintly, and stood for the most part only upon
the defensive, especially after they saw themselves disappointed of the
Duke of _Parma_’s Assistance. “The Duke of _Medina_, we are told[102],
to his Dishonour, was lodged in the Bottom of his Ship for his Safety,
and the rest of the Commanders would never turn their Ships, nor stop
them, to defend any of their own Friends that were forced to tarry
behind, but suffered divers to perish; and so fearful was the Admiral,
that if the _English_ had offered to board the _Spanish_ Ships, it was
thought they would have yielded without making any Resistance.” [103]In
this last Engagement the _Spaniards_ lost five thousand Men, a thousand
whereof were drowned[104]; and the next Day two _Venetian_ Ships sunk,
having eight hundred and forty three Men on board, which all perished.

[105]After this Fight there remained of the whole _Spanish_; Fleet but
one hundred and ten, or one hundred and twelve Ships, and those
extremely battered and shot through, and having their Rigging much
damaged with the Shot.

[106]The next Day, _July 30_, the Lord Admiral ordered the Lord _Henry
Seymour_, and Sir _William Winter_ to return back with their Squadron
into the narrow Seas, to guard the Coasts; as for himself, he resolved
to follow the _Spanish_ Fleet, ’till they came as far Northward as the
_Forth_ in _Scotland_, if they bent their Course that way; and, in the
mean time, he thought it best not to attack them any more, ’till he saw
what they proposed to do: However, being persuaded that they intended to
put into the Firth of _Forth_, his Lordship had devised Stratagems, and
taken Measures to make an utter End of them there.

[107]_July 31._ This Day the _Spaniards_ would fain have retreated,
early in the Morning, thro’ the Streights of _Dover_; but the Wind
coming up with hard Gales at North West, forced them towards the Coast
of _Zealand_; the _English_ then gave over the Chace, because they
perceived them hastening fast enough to their own Destruction; for with
the Wind at West North-West, they could not fail of being driven among
the Shallows and Sands of that Coast: But the Wind soon happening to
come about to the South-West and by West, the _Spaniards_ tacked, and
sailing before the Wind, got out of Danger. In the Evening, they held a
Council of War, wherein it was unanimously resolved[108], That seeing
they were in want of many Necessaries, especially of Cannon-Ball, that
the Ships were very much shattered, their Anchors left in _Calais-Road_,
their Provisions short, their Water spent, a great number of their
Soldiers slain, many of their Men sick and wounded, and that there was
no hopes of the Duke of _Parma_’s coming out to join them, they should
return to _Spain_, by the North of _Scotland_. Pursuant to this
Resolution, being now out of Danger, and in the main Ocean, and having
thrown all their Horses and Mules over board [Sidenote: GENERAL
CHART.]to save Water, they steer’d Northward, and the _English_ renew’d
the Chace after them; now and then the _Spanish_ Ships slacken’d their
Sails, and seem’d to stay for the coming up of the _English_, so that it
was generally thought their Fleet would tack about, but they thought
best, after all, to keep on their Course Northward.

                  *       *       *       *       *

Here it will not be improper to leave them for a while, and see what was
doing in the mean time in _England_[109].

The 9th of _August_ Queen _Elizabeth_ was pleased, in order both to
comfort her People, and to shew her own Magnanimity, to come and view
her Army and Camp at _Tilbury_; the next Morning after her Arrival, she
rode with a General’s Truncheon in her Hand, thro’ all the Ranks of the
Army, like armed _Pallas_, attended by the Earls of _Leicester_ and
_Essex_, _Henry Norris_, Lord Marshall, and others; having the Sword
carried before her by the Earl of _Ormond_; and among other kind and
obliging Discourses, made the following most excellent Speech to her
Army[110]:

          MY LOVING PEOPLE,

    _WE have been persuaded by some that are careful of our Safety, to
    take heed how we commit ourselves to armed Multitudes; but I assure
    you, I do not desire to live to distrust my faithful and loving
    People. Let Tyrants fear; I have always so behaved myself, that
    under_ GOD _I have placed my chiefest Strength and Safeguard in the
    loyal Hearts and Good-Will of my Subjects; and therefore I am come
    amongst you, as you see at this time, not for my Recreation and
    Disport, but being resolved, in the Midst and Heat of the Battle, to
    live or die amongst you all; to lay down for my_ GOD, _and for my
    Kingdom, and for my People, my Honour and my Blood, even in the
    Dust. I know I have the Body but of a weak and feeble Woman, but I
    have the Heart and Stomach of a King, and of a King of_ England
    _too; and think foul Scorn that_ Parma _or_ Spain, _or any Prince
    of_ Europe, _should dare to invade the Borders of my Realm; to
    which, rather than any Dishonour shall grow by me, I myself will
    take up Arms, I myself will be your General, Judge, and Rewarder of
    every one of your Virtues in the Field. I know already for your
    Forwardness, you have deserved Rewards and Crowns; and we do assure
    you, in the Word of a Prince, they shall be duly paid you. In the
    mean time, my Lieutenant-General shall be in my stead, than whom
    never Prince commanded a more noble or worthy Subject; not doubting
    but by your Obedience to my General, by your Concord in the Camp,
    and your Valour in the Field, we shall shortly have a famous Victory
    over those Enemies of my_ GOD, _of my Kingdoms, and of my People_.

[111]It is scarce to be conceived what a Spirit of Bravery this great
Queen’s Presence and noble Behaviour infus’d into the Officers and
Soldiers: [112]They saluted her with Cries, with Shouts, with all Tokens
of Love, of Obedience, and of Readiness to fight for her; they praised
her stately Person and princely Behaviour, prayed for her Life and
Happiness, and cursed all her Enemies, both Traitors and Papists, with
earnest Desire to venture their Lives for her Safety: [113]One who was
an Eye Witness relates moreover, that “the whole Armie in every Quarter,
did devoutely, at certaine Times, sing in her hearing, in a very tunable
manner, divers Psalmes put into Forme of Prayers in Praise of Almighty
GOD, which she greatly commended, and with very earnest Speech thanked
GOD with them[114].”

Next, if we look into _Flanders_, we shall find, [115]that on the 29th
of _July_, the Duke of _Parma_ having paid his Addresses to our Lady of
_Halle_, came to _Dunkirk_, tho’ something of the latest; for which
Reason the _Spaniards_ received him in a very reproachful manner; as if,
out of some By-Regards to Queen _Elizabeth_, he had designedly slipt so
fair an Opportunity of doing Wonders for the Service of his Country. The
Duke, to appease this Storm, punish’d those who had the Charge of
Victualling his Fleet; but, however, he did not attempt to put to Sea,
being still block’d up by the Lord _Henry Seymour_’s and Sir _William
Winter_’s Squadron, which were returned from the Chace. In the mean
time, he could not but secretly laugh at the saucy and insolent Brags of
the _Spaniards_, whom he had heard talking at this vain rate, “That
where ever they turn’d their Sails, a most certain Victory waited upon
their Course, and that the _English_ would not have Courage enough to
look them in the Face.”

                  *       *       *       *       *

To return now to the two Fleets. We left the _Spaniards_ sailing
Northward, and the _English_ in Pursuit of them: [116]When the latter
were come to fifty five Degrees thirteen Minutes North Latitude, and
thirty Leagues East of _Newcastle_, the Lord High Admiral determined to
attack the _Spanish_ Fleet again on the _Friday_ following, _August 2_,
but he thought fit to alter his Resolution, chiefly upon these two
Accounts: Because he plainly perceived by the Enemies Course, that they
had no other Intention but to save themselves, by sailing North, round
the _British_ Islands; and, because several of his Ships wanted Victuals
and other Necessaries; which was not so much owing to any Neglect, as to
the Victuallers not knowing where to send to the Fleet; for the Queen
had most amply and carefully provided whatever was convenient and
necessary.

It was therefore concluded, to leave the _Spanish_ Fleet to pursue their
Course, and to sail for the Firth of _Forth_; both to get Refreshment,
and to perform some other Business which the Lord Admiral thought
necessary to be done; but the Wind coming contrary, that is Westerly,
the next Day his Lordship altered his Course, and sending only some
Advice-Boats to observe the Enemies farther Motion, he returned with the
whole Fleet back to _England_, where they arrived, some at _Yarmouth_,
some at _Harwich_, and others at the _Downs_, about the 7th of _August_.

The _Spaniards_ being now got clear of their troublesome Pursuers,
resolv’d to make the best of their way for _Spain_. [117]Some Suspicions
there were, that they design’d to betake themselves to the King of
_Scots_, who was provok’d to an high degree for his Mother’s Death; and
therefore, the better to keep him in Temper, _Ashby_, the Queen of
_England_’s Ambassador in _Scotland_, made him very considerable Offers,
which, however, were not performed: But the _Spaniards_ having now laid
aside all Thoughts and Hopes of returning to attack the _English_; and
perceiving their main Safety lay in their Flight, they made no Stop at
any Port whatever. [118]About twenty five Ships now remain’d with the
Duke of _Medina_, and forty with _Recalde_; [119]these, with the rest of
the Fleet, sail’d about _Cathness_ for the Coast of _Ireland_, and
pass’d between the _Orcades_ and _Fair-Isle_, to the sixty first Degree
of North Latitude; [120]an unaccustom’d Place for the young Gallants of
_Spain_, that had never felt Storms on the Sea, or cold Weather in
_August_.

[121]When the _English_ left off pursuing the _Spaniards_, the latter
wanted of their whole Fleet fifteen or sixteen Ships; and had lost, in
the several Engagements, and by Sickness, eight thousand Men at least.

And here their ill Fortune did not stop, but continued to persecute them
all the rest of their Voyage; [122]for on the Coast of _Scotland_ they
lost the two following Ships, which had been so extremely battered by
the _English_ Shot, that they founder’d at Sea; namely, the _St.
Matthew_, a Ship of five hundred Tuns, in which four hundred and fifty
Men were drowned; and a Biscainer of _St. Sebastian’s_, of four hundred
Tuns, in which three hundred and fifty Men perished: [123]Moreover, in
these or other Ships, above seven hundred Soldiers were cast on Shore in
_Scotland_, who, by the Duke of _Parma_’s Mediation with the King of
_Scots_, and with Queen _Elizabeth_’s Permission, were sent over, a Year
after, into the _Low-Countries_.

[124]About four Days after the _English_ Fleet left the _Spaniards_,
they came to an Island in the North Part of _Scotland_, where they staid
not, nor had any Relief: And at this Place the Duke of _Medina_ calling
all the Ships together, charged them to make the best of their way for
the Coasts of _Spain_ or _Portugal_, because they were in the utmost
Distress for want of Victuals and other Provisions.

[125]For an Addition to their Misfortunes, about the 23d of _August_,
when there were seventy eight Ships of them together sailing in the
Ocean, a violent Storm arose at South-South-West, which continued from
Four o’ Clock in the Afternoon ’till Ten the next Morning, and separated
them so, that not above twenty seven of them were to be seen together:
And again, on the 2d of _September_, they had another violent Storm,
with a Mist, which so dispersed them, that of the foresaid twenty seven,
only three came together into _Dingle-Bay_; [126]and during their
Passage round the North of _Scotland_, they had so terrible a Sickness,
that their Mariners and Soldiers died daily in great Multitudes.

As for the Particulars of the Ships sunk, and Men drowned, killed, and
taken upon the Coast of _Ireland_, during the Month of _September_, they
were as follows[127]:

[128]Besides which, _Our Lady of the Rosary_, the Admiral Ship of the
_Guypuscoan_ Squadron, of near a thousand Tuns, and thirty Guns, that
had fifty Brass Field-Pieces on board, was lost upon the Rocks in
_Bleskey-Sound_; so that of five hundred Men, only one escap’d; and in
this perished the Prince of _Ascula_, a natural Son of King _Philip_,
_Mighel de Oquendo_ the Captain, and several other considerable and
eminent Persons.

According to other Accounts[129], nine _Spanish_ Ships were driven
ashore between the Rivers of _Lough-Foile_ and _Lough-Swilley_, many
whereof were broken to Pieces, and the _Spaniards_ forced to shelter
among the wild _Irish_.

[130]As for such of the _Spaniards_ as had the ill Fortune to be drove
upon the _Irish_ Shore, they met with the most barbarous Treatment; for
some of them were butcher’d by the wild _Irish_, and the rest put to the
Sword by the Lord Deputy Sir _William Fitz-Williams_, who fearing they
might join with the _Irish_ Malecontents, and observing that _Bingham_,
Governor of _Connaught_ treated them with more Gentleness than he had
several times ordered him to do; upon their Surrender, he dispatched
_Fowle_, Deputy Marshal, to execute his Orders; who first dislodg’d them
from the Places where they lay conceal’d, and then executed about two
hundred of them: But this Rigour the Queen condemn’d, and complain’d of
as too extreme: However, the rest being terrified by this way of
proceeding, tho’ they were sick and half famish’d, yet chose to trust
themselves to their shatter’d Barks, and the Mercy of the Seas; and so
became many of them a Sacrifice to the Waves. The Duke of _Medina_, with
twenty or twenty five Ships, keeping in the Ocean, return’d to _Spain_.

[131]About forty of the _Spanish_ Ships fell in with the _Irish_ Coast,
and intended to touch at Cape _Clear_, in hopes of meeting there with
some Refreshment; but the Wind proving contrary, and the Weather
tempestuous, many of them perish’d on that Coast; [132]of those that got
off, some were driven by a strong West Wind into the _English_ Channel,
where part of them were attack’d again and taken by the _English_,
others by the _Rochellers_, and some arriv’d at _Newhaven_ (or _Havre de
Grace_) in _Normandy_.

Such were the _Spaniards_ Losses of Men and Ships, in their return round
_Ireland_.

The Losses they had suffered before, were thus:

                                                  Loss   Men.

           ──────────────────────────────────────────────────


So that by adding their several Losses together, it plainly appears,
they lost THIRTY FIVE Ships, and above THIRTEEN THOUSAND Men; besides
many others of which no Estimate was or could be made[133]; and above
two thousand Prisoners were taken in the Fight in _Ireland_, and the
_Low-Countries_: Those taken in _Ireland_ were brought to
_England_[134], and confined in _Bridewell_ ’till they were ransomed.
The most eminent of the Prisoners were, Don _Pedro de Valdez_, Don
_Vasquez de Silvea_, Don _Alonzo de Sayes_, and others taken in the
Channel; in _Ireland_, Don _Alonzo de Luzon_, _Roderigo de Lasso_, _&c._
in _Zealand_, Don _Diego Piementelli_, _&c._ In a Word, there was hardly
a noble Family in all _Spain_, that did not lose a Son, a Brother, or a
Kinsman; upon which account the Mourning was so universal in that whole
Kingdom, [135]that King _Philip_ was obliged by Proclamation to shorten
the usual Time; as the _Romans_ of old, upon their great Defeat of
_Cannæ_, found it necessary to limit the publick Mourning to thirty
Days.

[136]The shatter’d Remains of the _Spanish_ Fleet after having weather’d
many Storms, and suffered all the Inconveniences of War and Weather,
arriv’d at last, about the End of _September_, at _St. Andero_, and
other Ports of _Spain_, laden with nothing but Shame and Dishonour. The
Duke of _Medina_ was forbid the Court, and ordered to go and live
privately; _Martinez de Recalde_ died immediately after his Return; and
two of their Ships were accidentally burnt in the Harbour not long after
their Arrival. Surely such a Series of ill Success was hardly ever known
in any other Age or Nation.

As for the _English_ they lost only Captain _Coxe_’s Ship
abovementioned, and not more than one hundred Men.

                  *       *       *       *       *

Such was the End of the formidable _Spanish_ Armada, that had been three
Years fitting out at a vast Expence; and which in less than three Months
was shamefully beaten, and put to a most ignominious Flight,
[137]without taking at the same time, in several Engagements, and in
many Days Fight, any _English_ Ship or Boat, or making one Prisoner; not
having so much as fired a Cottage at Land, or taken a Cock-Boat of ours
at Sea, as the Lord _Bacon_ observes[138], it wandered through the
Wilderness of the Northern Seas; and, according to the Curse in
Scripture, _Came out against us one way, and fled before us seven ways_.
Well might the _Spaniards_ marvel at this, and be heartily vexed, as one
of their Friends observes they did; [139]so as some of them to say in
their Anguish of Heart, “That in all these Fights, CHRIST shewed himself
a _Lutheran_! Surely it is most manifest, as he goes on, That in all
this Voiage, from the Armada’s coming out of _Lisbon_, even to the very
last, GOD shewed no Favour to the _Spaniards_ any one Day, as he did
continually to the _English_.”

For this signal Deliverance, the Thanks of all true Lovers of their
Country, and of the Protestant Religion, are due to that Almighty Being,
by whose Assistance their Ancestors obtained the Victory; and it ought
at the same time, to make them love and reverence the Memory of that
wise and excellent Queen, by whose Prudence and good Management they
were enabled to conquer.

[140]Upon the first News of this wonderful Deliverance and Victory, the
Kingdom was filled with Joy, and a Sense of Gratitude to GOD. The first
Notice given of it in publick, was on the 20th of _August_, when _Nowel_
Dean of St. _Paul_’s preached at the Cross a Thanksgiving Sermon before
the Lord-Mayor, Aldermen, and the Companies in their best Liveries.
Again _September_ the 8th being another and chief Thanksgiving Day, the
Preacher at St. _Paul_’s Cross moved the People to give Thanks for their
Enemies Overthrow; and at the same time were set upon the lower
Battlements of the Church, eleven Ensigns or Banners taken from the
_Spanish_ Fleet; one Streamer in particular, on which was represented
the Virgin _Mary_ with her Son in her Arms, was held in a Man’s Hand
over the Pulpit: These Banners were afterwards carried to the Cross in
_Cheapside_[141]; and the next Day, _September 9_, were hanged on
_London-Bridge_ towards _Southwark_, where the Fair was kept. The 17th
of _November_, being _Sunday_, was another Rejoicing-Day, as well upon
account of the Queen’s Accession to the Throne, as for this Victory. Her
Majesty intended to have been at _Paul_’s Cross, to hear a Sermon
preach’d by Dr. _Cooper_ Bishop of _Winchester_, and Provision had
accordingly been made for her Reception; but upon some Occasion or
other, her coming was put off ’till the _Sunday_ following: The 19th
being _Tuesday_ was a general Thanksgiving-Day throughout the whole
Kingdom. The next _Sunday, November 24_, the Queen, attended by her
Privy Council, by the Nobility, and other honourable Persons, as well
Spiritual as Temporal, in great number, the _French_ Ambassador, the
Judges, the Heralds, and Trumpeters all on Horseback, came in a Chariot
supported by four Pillars, and drawn by two white Horses, to St.
_Paul_’s Church; where alighting at the West Door, she fell on her
Knees, and audibly praised GOD for her own and the Nation’s signal
Deliverance; and, after a Sermon suitable to the Occasion, preached by
Dr. _Pierce_, Bishop of _Sarum_, she exhorted the People in a most Royal
and Christian manner, to a due Performance of the religious Duty of
Thanksgiving; then going to the Bishop of _London_’s Palace, where she
dined, she returned in the same Order as before, by Torch-light, to
_Somerset-House_.

Those brave Men that had ventur’d their Lives in the Defence of their
Country, were considered and rewarded by the Queen. [142]She settled a
Pension on the Lord High-Admiral for his great Service, and bestow’d a
handsome yearly Allowance on the poor and disabled Seamen; and upon all
Occasions she distinguish’d the rest of the Officers, Soldiers, and
Sailors with particular Marks of her Regard and Esteem; but their
Rewards consisted generally more in Words than in Deeds.


A short EXPLANATION and ACCOUNT of what is contained in each of the ten
                  Tapestry-Plates, and the ten Charts.


The first Plate of the Tapestry and Chart I. represent the _Spanish_
  Fleet coming up the _Channel_, opposite to the _Lizard_, as it was
  first discovered. See _Account of the Spanish Invasion_, p. 12, 13.

Plate II. and Chart II. The _Spanish_ Fleet against _Fowey_, drawn up in
  the Form of a Half Moon, and the _English_ Fleet pursuing them.
  _Account_, _&c._ p. 13.

Plate III. and Chart III. At the left Hand Corner is represented the
  first Engagement between the _Spanish_ and _English_ Fleets: After
  which the _English_ give Chace to the _Spaniards_, who draw themselves
  up into a Roundel. _Account_, _&c._ _ibid._

Plate IV. and Chart IV. _De Valdez_’s Galleon springs her Foremast, and
  is taken by Sir _Francis Drake_. The Lord-Admiral with the _Bear_ and
  _Mary Rose_, pursue the Enemy, who are in the Form of a Half Moon.
  _Account_, _&c._ p. 13, 14.

Plate V. and Chart V. The Admiral of the _Guypuscoan_ Squadron being set
  on Fire, is taken by the _English_. The rest of the _Spanish_ Fleet
  continue their Course in the Form of a Half Moon: And when both Fleets
  were against the Isle of _Portland_, they come to an Engagement.
  _Account_, _&c._ p. 14.

Plate VI. and Chart VI. Some _English_ Ships attack the _Spanish_ Fleet
  to the Westward. The _Spaniards_ draw themselves into a Roundel: And
  afterwards keeping on their Course, are followed by the _English_.
  _Account_, _&c._ p. 14, 15.

Plate VII. and Chart VII. Represent the sharpest Engagement that
  happen’d between the two Fleets, on _July 25_, against the Isle of
  _Wight_. _Account_, _&c._ p. 15.

In Plate VIII. and Chart VIII. the _Spanish_ Fleet is seen sailing up
  the _Channel_, intending to stop at _Dunkirk_ or _Calais_, where they
  were to be join’d by the Duke of _Parma_: The _English_ follow them
  close. _Account_, _&c._ p. 16.

Plate IX. and Chart IX. The _Spaniards_ come to an Anchor before
  _Calais_, from whence they are dislodg’d by the Fireships sent amongst
  them in the Night: The _English_ prepare to pursue them. _Account_,
  _&c._ p. 16, 17.

Plate X. and Chart X. The _Spaniards_ make the best of their way for the
  Northern Seas; and are, in the mean time, very much battered by the
  _English_, who closely pursue them. The chief Galleass is stranded
  near _Calais_. _Account_, _&c._ p. 17, 18, 19.

The Reader is desired to observe, that the Border in Plate II, IV, VI,
VIII, X, is an exact Representation of the Border to the
Tapestry-Hangings, which is ornamented with the Portraits of the
principal Commanders; and is the same in all the Pieces of the Tapestry;
only the Heads are differently placed. But for more Variety, and in
order to bring in the Heads of Sir _Robert Carey_, the Earl of
_Northumberland_, Sir _Roger Townshend_, and Sir _Thomas Gerard_,
another Border has been contrived, being that which is round Plate I,
III, V, VII, IX.

We are inform’d by _Joachim de Sandrart_[143], that the _Designs_ of the
Tapestry were made by _Henry Cornelius Vroom_, a famous Painter of
_Harlem_, eminent for his great Skill in drawing all Sorts of Shipping;
and that it was _Wove_ by _Francis Spiring_.


    EXPLANATION of the MEDALS and other ORNAMENTS round the Charts.


Gen. Chart. On the left Side BRITANNIA is represented darting Thunder
  and Lightning, upon ENVY, SUPERSTITION, and the Kingdom of _Spain_,
  delineated by those of _Castile_ and _Leon_, which lye groveling

  _Elizabeth_’s Picture hangs the Anchor of Hope, the Arms of the
  Admiralty, surrounded by the Winds; and below stands NEPTUNE, the God
  of the Sea, in his Chariot, to denote the Queen’s Dominion of the
  Narrow Seas. At the Corner of the first Chart BRITANNIA sitting upon a
  Rock in the Sea, and looking scornfully upon the _Spanish_ Fleet, has
  this very pertinent Motto by her,

        _Maturate fugam_, _&c._

        _Hence to your Lord my Royal Mandate bear,
        The Realms of Ocean, and the Fields of Air,
        Are mine, not his._

                               APPENDIX.

                                  ---


                                 NOTE.


The Spanish Armada made an effort, July 25, 1588, to land and take
possession of the Isle of Wight, when a spirited engagement took place,
which caused the Spanish admiral to pursue his course to Calais Roads.

The next day the Lord High Admiral of the English fleet called on board
of his own ship, the “Arke-Royal,” and conferred the honor of knighthood
on the Lord Thomas Howard, the Lord Sheffield Roger Townshend, Martin
Frobisher, and John Hawkins, as a reward for their undaunted spirit and
bravery in this great fight at sea, having power from the Queen so to
do.

As brief biographical sketches of these important commanders may be
interesting, the following have been taken from various historical,
biographical, and genealogical works:—


                     THE LORD HOWARD OF EFFINGHAM.


Charles, second Lord Howard of Effingham, and Lord High Admiral of
England, was son of the first lord and grandson of Thomas, second Duke
of Norfolk.

He was born 1536, and after much service was appointed, in 1585, Lord
High Admiral of England, and was chief in command against the Spanish
Armada, in 1588.

As he was a staunch Roman Catholic, history will forever honor the
tremendous efforts made by him to frustrate the landing of this powerful
combination of land and sea forces, fitted out as it were under the
auspices of the Pope of Rome, and his loyalty to his Queen and country.

In 1596, he commanded the fleet while the Earl of Essex commanded the
land forces in the expedition against Cadiz. For this meritorious
service he was created Earl of Nottingham. In 1599, in anticipation of
another invasion by the King of Spain, he was given the sole command of
the army and navy, with the title of Lieutenant-General of all England.
He commanded the troop that subdued the Essex rebellion, and under James
I. was employed in several distinguished capacities, and died December
14, 1624, aged eighty-eight, having some years before resigned the
office of Lord High Admiral, in the behalf of the favorite Villiers,
Earl of Buckingham, receiving in exchange a pension of £1,000, and the
acquittal of a debt of £1,800 due the Crown.


                        THE LORD THOMAS HOWARD.


The Lord Thomas Howard was a son of the fourth Duke of Norfolk. His
lordship was a distinguished commander in the memorable engagement
between the English fleet and the Spanish Armada, in 1588.

In 1591 he had command of a squadron of ships sent out to attack the
Spanish Plate fleet, homeward bound from America, and distinguished
himself, with Sir Thomas Vasseur, in capturing a part of this fleet.

He was, in 1596, in the fleet commanded by Charles Howard, Lord High
Admiral of England. This Thomas Howard led the third squadron, and it
was this fleet which took the town of Cadiz. The same year, on his
return, he was summoned to Parliament by the title of Lord Howard of
Walden.

The next year, to divert the Spaniard from a descent on Ireland, the
Queen sent out a fleet of one hundred and twenty, divided into three
squadrons, commanded by the Earl of Essex, Lord Thomas Howard, and Sir
Walter Raleigh. On his return to England, he was installed one of the
Knights of the Garter, May 24, 1597.

In 1601, he was one of the commanders of the forces to whom the Earl of
Essex surrendered, and on the 19th February following he was one of the
peers that sat on his trial, being then constable of the Tower. Meeting
King James I. at Theobalds, in May, 1603, he was sworn of the Privy
Council, and July 21st following was advanced to the Earldom of Suffolk.
He was also made a Commissioner for making Knights of the Bath, also for
executing the office of Earl Marshal of England. In 1605, being Lord
Chamberlain together with the Lord Mounteagle, the Gunpowder Plot was
discovered. He was elected Chancellor of the University of Cambridge in
1613, and July 11, 1614, was constituted Lord High Treasurer of England.
The earl died in London, May 28, 1626.


                          SIR ROGER TOWNSHEND.


Sir Roger Townshend of Raynham, Knight, was descended, according to
Collins and other learned antiquaries, through a long line of ancestry
from Lodovic or Lewis, a Norman nobleman, who married Elizabeth,
daughter and heir of Sir Thomas de Hauteville or Havile, Lord of
Raynham, through which match the Raynham estate came into the family and
is now the chief seat of the Marquis Townshend.

This Sir Roger was born about 1550, and was heir to his great
grandfather, Sir Roger Townshend, Kt., whose will was proved at Norwich,
Co. Norfolk, May 10, 1552. He was a gentleman of high rank and great
worth in his native county Norfolk, and while Spain was preparing the
Invincible Armada of 1588 to invade England, he manifested the greatest
spirit and energy in fitting out and manning ships at his own expense to
repel the invaders, going in person in the cause of his country, and on
account of his undaunted spirit and bravery in the several engagements
previous to the 26th of July, he was knighted that day on board the _Ark
Royal_, by the Admiral Lord Howard of Effingham, who had power from
Queen Elizabeth so to do. This Sir Roger was in the thickest of the
fight and suffered the loss of many of his men, and we have evidence
from a letter dated at Margate, Kent, August 10, 1588, in which Lord
Howard writes Burghley “that of all the men brought by Sir Roger
Townshend he has but one left alive.”

He lived but two years afterwards, dying in the flower of his age at a
seat he had purchased of Thomas Sutton, Esq., at Newington, Co.
Middlesex, and was buried June 30, 1590, in the church of St. Giles,
Cripplegate, London.


                           SIR JOHN HAWKINS.


Sir John Hawkins, a seaman of distinguished ability who flourished
during the reign of Elizabeth, was born at Plymouth about 1520, and his
early life was spent in trading voyages to the south of Europe and
African coast. With the assistance of several merchants he fitted out a
small fleet in 1562, and obtained by force and purchase a cargo of
negroes, which he carried to the Spanish West India Colonies and there
sold them; this we believe was the first adventure in the African slave
trade made by Englishmen.

He made many voyages of this kind, and was at last attacked by the
Spanish authorities in the Port of S. Juan de Ulloa, and saved only two
of his ships and returned to England in January, 1568, after suffering
much hardship. This was his last commercial enterprise.

Hawkins was appointed in 1573 treasurer of the navy, and in 1588 we find
him serving as Rear Admiral against the Spanish Armada, and for his
great spirit and bravery he was knighted by the Admiral Charles Lord
Howard of Effingham. He went to intercept the Plate fleet and harrass
the trade of Spain with Frobishers and others in 1590, but failed in the
first object and succeeded in the second. In 1595, he was sent with
Drake to command an expedition against the Spaniards in the West Indies;
but they failed to agree and soon after separated. Sir John Hawkins died
November 21, 1595, and his colleague, Drake, soon after. Hawkins founded
a hospital at Chatham for poor and sick seamen. He also sat in
Parliament for Plymouth.


                         SIR MARTIN FROBISHER.


Sir Martin Frobisher was born at Doncaster, Yorkshire, of humble
parentage, and brought up to the sea, and in early life displayed the
talents of a great navigator, and was the first Englishman who attempted
to find a northwest passage to China. Under the patronage of Ambrose
Dudley, Earl of Warwick, he fitted out two barks of twenty-five tons,
and a pinnace of ten tons, and sailed from Deptford, January 8, 1576,
and on July 11th discovered Freeseland and the strait which still bears
his name, and after making numerous discoveries he returned to England,
arriving at Harwich 2d October of the same year. On this voyage he took
possession of the country in Queen Elizabeth’s name and brought back
with him specimens of gold ore. This circumstance raised prodigious
expectations, and the Queen lent him a ship of two hundred tons for his
next expedition, on which he sailed accompanied with a party of one
hundred and forty persons (also two barks of thirty tons each) from
Gravesend, May 26, 1577. He made numerous discoveries, but his
instructions were to search for ore, and being in the Countess of
Warwick Island he took a lading of it and arrived in England the end of
September, 1577, and was most graciously received by the Queen, who
fitted out another fleet of twelve vessels which sailed from Harwich May
31, 1578, and sighted Freeseland June 20th, and took possession of the
country in the Queen’s name, calling it West England, and after
collecting much ore sailed for and arrived in England after a stormy and
dangerous passage in the beginning of October. In 1588 he commanded the
_Triumph_ in the engagement against the Spanish Armada and received the
honor of knighthood for his valor at sea by the Lord High Admiral, 26
July of the same year. In 1590, he commanded a squadron to the Spanish
Coast, and in 1594 he was sent with four men-of-war to the assistance of
Henry IV. of France, against a body of leaguers and Spaniards then in
possession of part of Brittany, who had fortified themselves very
strongly at Croyzon near Brest. Here, in an assault upon that fort,
November 7th he was wounded by a ball in the hip, of which he died soon
after he had brought the fleet safely back to Plymouth, and was buried
in that town.


                          SIR WALTER RALEIGH.


Sir Walter Raleigh, a distinguished statesman, scholar, and warrior, in
the reigns of Elizabeth and James I., was born in 1552, at Budleigh in
Devonshire, and educated at Oriel College, Oxford. At the age of
seventeen he made one of a troop of an hundred gentlemen volunteers whom
Queen Elizabeth permitted to go to France, under the command of Henry
Champernon, for the service of the Protestant princes. He next served in
the Netherlands; and, on his return from the Continent, his
half-brother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, having obtained a grant of lands in
North America, he engaged with a considerable number of gentlemen to go
out to Newfoundland: but the expedition proving unsuccessful, Sir Walter
returned to England, after being exposed to several dangers, and
proceeded thence to Ireland, where he made his bravery so conspicuous in
quelling the insurgents, that he was received at court with considerable
favor, and obtained permission and supplies to prosecute his discoveries
in America, which ended in his settling a colony in that country,
called, in honor of his maiden sovereign, Virginia; and he is said to
have first introduced tobacco and potatoes into Europe. In the mean time
the Queen conferred on him the distinction of knighthood, and rewarded
him by several lucrative grants, including a large share of the
forfeited Irish estates. When his country’s safety was threatened by the
famous Spanish Armada, he raised and disciplined the militia of
Cornwall; and afterwards, by joining the fleet with a squadron of ships
belonging to gentlemen volunteers, assisted in obtaining the signal
victory which it pleased Providence to give to the English over the
Spaniards on that occasion. He was now made gentleman of the privy
chamber; but shortly after fell into disgrace, and was confined for some
months, partly on account of a tract which he had published, entitled
“the School for Atheists,” which was unfairly construed by his enemies
into a vindication of atheistical principles; and partly for a
clandestine attachment to one of the Queen’s maids of honor, the
daughter of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton; which lady, however, he
afterwards honorably married. During his seclusion he planned the
discovery of the extensive country of Guiana, in South America, in which
he took an active part himself, as soon as he was set at liberty: but
the season being unfavorable, he returned to England, and was soon after
appointed to a command in the important expedition to Cadiz, of which
the success was in a great measure owing to Sir Walter’s valor and
prudence. This, joined to several other important services, restored him
completely to the favor of Elizabeth, towards the end of her reign. Her
successor, James, prejudiced against him by Robert Cecil, disapproving
of his martial spirit, and jealous of his abilities, availed himself of
a court conspiracy against this great man, charging him with
participating in an attempt to place upon the throne Arabella Stuart,
and of carrying on a secret correspondence with the King of Spain. By
the base subservience of the jury, he was brought in guilty of high
treason, even to the surprise of the Attorney-General Coke himself, who
declared that he had only charged him with misprision of treason.
Raleigh was reprieved, and committed to the Tower, where his wife, at
her earnest solicitation, was allowed to reside with him, and where his
youngest son was born. Twelve years was Sir Walter detained a prisoner
in the Tower; during which time, besides various minor compositions, he
wrote his “History of the World;” a work distinguished for the richness
of its information, the judiciousness of its reflections, and the vigor
of its style. At length his release was obtained, in 1616, by the
advance of a large sum of money to the new favorite, Villiers; and, to
retrieve his broken fortunes, he planned another expedition to America.
He obtained a patent under the great seal for making a settlement in
Guiana; but, in order to retain a power over him, the king did not grant
him a pardon for the sentence passed upon him for his alleged treason.
Having reached the Orinoco, he dispatched a portion of his force to
attack the new Spanish settlement of St. Thomas, which was captured; but
he had to lament the death of his eldest son, who fell on that occasion.
The expected plunder proved of little value: and Sir Walter, having in
vain tried to induce his captains to attack other Spanish settlements,
arrived at Plymouth in July, 1618. Being brought before the court of
King’s Bench, his plea of an implied pardon by his subsequent command,
was overruled; and the doom of death being pronounced against him, it
was carried into execution the following day, October 28, 1819, in Old
Palace Yard. His behavior at the scaffold was calm, and, after
addressing the people at some length in his own justification, he
received the stroke of death with perfect composure; remarking to the
sheriff, with a smile, as he felt the edge of the axe, “This is a sharp
medicine, but it is a physician that will cure all diseases.”


                               JOHN PINE.


Very little is known of the parentage of John Pine, the original
engraver and publisher of this work.

He flourished between the years 1720-1750, and ranked second to none in
his profession. He was a most intimate friend of Hogarth, who showed his
admiration for him by painting him in the manner of Rembrandt.

The years of his birth and death are uncertain. His chief works are the
Ceremonies used at the Revival of the Order of the Bath; a splendid
edition of Horace, illustrated with copies of antiques, bas-reliefs,
gems, and coins: also a print of the House of Commons.

His engravings of the tapestry hangings of the House of Lords are
sufficient evidence of his ability as an engraver. These splendid
representations of the engagements between the English fleet and the
Spanish Armada were destroyed by fire when the Houses of Parliament were
burned, Oct. 16, 1834.

  in by Sir _Francis Drake_; the Sum of which was this: Don _Pedro_
  being asked what was the Intent of their coming, stoutly answer’d the
  Lords, What, but to subdue your Nation, and root it out. Good, said
  the Lords, and what meant you then to do with the Catholicks? He
  answered, We meant to send them (good Men) directly unto Heaven, as
  all you that are Hereticks to Hell. Yea but, said the Lords, What
  meant you to do with your Whips of Cord and Wyer? (whereof they had
  great Store in their Ships,) What, said he, we meant to whip you
  Hereticks to Death, that have assisted my Master’s Rebels, and done
  such Dishonours to our Catholick King and People. Yea, but what would
  you have done said they, with their young Children. They, said he,
  which were above seven Years old should have gone the Way their
  Fathers went; the rest should have lived, branded in the Forehead with
  the Letter _L_, for _Lutheran_, to perpetual Bondage, _Cabala_, p.
  372. Letter to _Mendoza_, p. 37.——It was also published, that the
  Lords of _Spain_ which were in the Navy, had made a special Division
  amongst themselves, of all the Noblemens Houses in _England_ by their
  Names, and had in a sort quartered _England_ among themselves, and had
  determined of sundry manners of cruel Death, both of the Nobility and
  the rest of the People. The Ladies, Women, and Maidens were also
  destined to all Villany; the rich Merchants Houses in _London_ were
  put into a Register, by their very Names, and limited to the Companies
  of the Squadrons of the Navy for their Spoil. Letter to _Mendoza_, p.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
