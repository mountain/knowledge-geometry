        ¶ A Proclamation
 declaring his Maiesties pleasure
 concerning the dissoluing of the
     present Conuention of
           Parliament.


Albeit the Assembling, Continuing, and Dissoluing of Parliaments, be
a Prerogatiue so peculiarly belonging to Our Imperiall Crowne, and
the times and seasons thereof so absolutelie in our owne power, that
Wee neede not giue account thereof vnto any: yet, according to Our
continuall custome, to make Our good Subiects acquainted with the
reasons of all Our publike resolutions and actions, We haue thought
it expedient at this time to declare, not onely Our pleasure and
resolution therein, grounded vpon mature deliberation, with the aduice
and vniforme consent of Our whole Priuie Councell; but therewith also
to note some especiall proceedings moouing Vs to this resolution: And
that chieflie to this end, that as God, so the World may witnesse with
Vs, that it was Our intent to haue made this the happiest Parliament
that euer was in Our time: And that the lettes and impediments
thereof being discerned, all misunderstandings and iealousies might
be remooued, and all Our people may know and beleeue, that Wee are as
farre from imputing any of those ill accidents, that haue happened
in Parliament, to any want or neglect of duty, or good affection
towards Vs, by them in generall, or by the greater and better number of
Parliament men, as We are confident (the true causes discouered) they
wilbe farre from imputing it to any default in Vs; there hauing in the
beginning of this late Assemblie passed greater and more infallible
tokens of loue and duty from Our Subiects to Vs their Soueraigne, and
more remarkeable testimonies from Vs of Our Princely care and zeale of
their welfare, then haue beene in any Parliament met in any former Age.

This Parliament was by Vs called, as for making good and profitable
Lawes, so more especially, in this time of miserable distraction
throughout Christendome, for the better setling of peace and Religion,
and restoring Our Children to their ancient and lawfull patrimony,
which We attempted to procure by peaceable treaty, at Our owne
excessiue charge, thereby to saue and preuent the effusion of Christian
blood, the miserable effect of warre, and dissension; yet with full
purpose, if that succeeded not, to recouer it by the sword; and
therfore, as a necessary meanes conducing to those ends, the supply of
Our Treasures was to bee prouided for.

This Parliament beginning in Ianuary last, proceeded some moneths with
such harmonie betweene Vs and Our people, as cannot bee paralleld by
any former time: For as the House of Commons at the first, both in
the manner of their supplie, and otherwise, shewed greater loue, and
more respect then euer any House of Commons did to Vs, or (as Wee
thinke) to any King before Vs: So Wee, vpon all their complaints,
haue afforded them such memorable and rare examples of Iustice, as
many ages past cannot shew the like; wherein, that Wee preferred
the weale of Our people before all particular respects, the things
themselues doe sufficiently prooue, Our Iustice being extended, not
onely to persons of ordinary ranke and qualitie, but euen to the prime
Officer of Our Kingdome. And although, after their first Recesse at
Easter, Wee found that they misspent a great deale of time, rather
vpon the inlarging of the limites of their liberties, and diuers other
curious, and vnprofitable things, then vpon the framing and proponing
of good and profitable Lawes: Yet Wee gaue them time and scope for
their Parliamentary proceedings, and prolonged the Session to an
vnusuall length, continuing it vntill the eight and twentieth day of
May, before Wee signified Our purpose for their Recesse; and then Wee
declared, that Wee would make a Recesse on the fourth day of Iune next
following, but only for a time, and in such maner, as might bee without
disturbance to any their businesses in hand, expressing out of Our
Grace (though We needed not) the causes of that Our purpose, which were
the season of the yeere, vsually hot, and vnfit for great assemblies,
Our Progresse approaching, the necessitie Wee had to make vse of
Our Councell attending in both houses, both to settle Our waightie
affaires of State before Wee went, and to attend Vs when Wee went Our
Progresse, the disfurnishing of Our ordinary Courts of Iustice so many
Termes together, the long absence of Iustices of Peace, and Deputy
Lieuetenants, whose presence was needfull for making and returning of
musters, and for subordinate gouernement of the Countrey; and therefore
We appointed to adiourne the Parliament on the fourth day of Iune,
giuing that warning longer then vsuall, that they might set in order
their businesses, and prepare their greeuances, which Wee promised both
to heare and answer before that Recesse, for presenting whereof Wee
appointed them a time. This message graciously intended by Vs, was not
so well entertained by some, who in a short time dispersed and spred
their iealousies vnto others, and thereby occasioned discontentment
in the House, for being adiourned without passing of Billes; Yet made
not their addresse to Vs, as had beene meet, but desired a conference
with the Lords; and at that conference, the nine and twentieth day of
May, vnder colour of desiring to petition Vs for some further time,
to perfect and passe some speciall Bils, were imboldened, not onely
to dispute, but to retell all the reasons that We had giuen for the
adiournement, which being made knowen vnto Vs, Wee againe signified Our
pleasure to both Houses, that on the fourth day of Iune the Parliament
should rise, but We would then giue Our Royall assent to such billes,
as were or should be ready and fit to be then passed, continuing all
other businesses in state they were by a speciall Act to bee framed for
that purpose.

The Lords with all duetie and respect, submitted to Our resolution,
passed the Act, and sent it with speciall recommendation to the House
of Commons; but they neither read it, nor proceeded with businesses,
but forgetting that the time was Ours and not theirs, continued their
discontentment, as they pretended, for being so soone dismissed.
We (though it were strange to obserue such auersnesse for Our
resoluing vpon such waighty reasons, that wherin Wee needed not to
bee measured by any other rule, but Our owne Princely will) yet were
contented to descend from Our owne Right, to alter Our resolution,
and to continue the Session for a fortnight more, wherein they might
perfite such publique Billes, as were esteemed of most importance: for
which purpose, We Our selfe came in person vnto the Higher house of
Parliament, and made offer thereof vnto them, which being in effect
as much as the Commons had formerly desired, was no sooner offered,
but yeelding thankes to Vs, the said Commons resolued the same day
directly, contrary to their former desire, to refuse it, and to
accept Our first Resolution of an adiournement; but attending Vs at
Greenwich, presented no grieuances: This inconstancie, as Wee passed
by with a gentle admonition; so for the matter of grieuances, aswell
of England, as Ireland, We promised to take them into Our owne care,
though not presented to Vs, and really performed the same so farre
forth, as time, and the aduice of Our Councell of each Kingdome could
enable Vs, as is witnessed by Our seuerall Proclamations, published
in both Realms, as likewise in granting at the same time those three
suites which were proponed vnto Vs by the Arch-Bishop of Canterbury,
at the request, and in the name of both the Houses: But in conclusion
of the house of Commons making it their choise, Wee made a Recesse by
adiournement of the Parliament, the fourth day of Iune; Though indeed
We must doe them this right, that at the said Recesse, taking into
their serious consideration the present estate of Our children abroad,
and the generall afflicted estate of the true Professors of Religion
in forraine parts, they did with one vnanimous consent, in the name of
themselues, and the whole body of the Kingdome, make a most dutifull
and solemne protestation, that if Our pious Endeauours, by treatie to
procure their peace and safetie, should not take that good effect which
was desired, (in the treatie whereof, they humbly besought Vs, not to
suffer any long delay) then, vpon signification of Our pleasure in
Parliament, they would be ready, to the vttermost of their powers, both
with liues and fortunes to assist Vs; so as that by the diuine helpe
of Almightie God, We might be able to doe that by Our sword, which by
peaceable courses should not be effected.

But during the time of this long Recesse, hauing to Our great charges
mediated with the Emperour, by the meanes of Our Embassadour, the
Lord =DIGBIE=, and hauing found those hopes to fayle, which We had to
preuaile by treaty, Wee in confidence of the Assistance of Our people,
thus freely promised and protested in Parliament, did instantly shorten
the time of the Recesse, (which We had before appointed to continue
vntill the eighth day of February,) and did reassemble Our Parliament,
the twentieth day of Nouember last, and made knowen vnto them the true
state and necessity of Our Childrens affayres, declaring Our resolution
vnto them, of taking vpon Vs the defence of Our Childrens patrimony,
by way of Armes, since We could not compasse it by an amicable treaty;
and therefore expected the fruit of that their declaration, whereby We
were inuited vnto this course: wherein, howbeit We are well satisfied
of the good inclination of the most part of Our House of Commons,
testified by their ready assent to the speedy payment of a Subsidie,
newly to bee granted, yet vpon this occasion some particular members
of that House tooke such inordinate liberty, not only to treat of Our
high Prerogatiues, and of sundry things, that without Our speciall
direction were no fit subiects to be treated of in Parliament; but
also to speake with lesse respect of forraigne Princes, Our Allies,
then were fit for any Subiect to doe of anoynted Kings, though in
enmity and hostility with Vs. And when, vpon this occasion, Wee vsed
some reprehension towardes those miscarriages, requiring them not
to proceede but in such things as were within the capacity of that
House, according to the continuall custome of Our Predecessors, then
by the meanes of some euil affected and discontented persons, such
heat and distemper was raysed in the House, that albeit themselues
had sued vnto Vs for a Session, and for a generall Pardon, vnto both
which at their earnest suit We assented, yet after this fire kindled,
they reiected both, and setting apart all businesses of consequence &
waight (notwithstanding Our admonition and earnest pressing them to
goe on) they either sate as silent, or spent the time in disputing of
Priuiledges, descanting vpon the words and syllables of Our Letters
& messages, which for better cleering of trueth, and satisfaction of
all men, We are about to publish in Print, so soone as possibly We
can. And although in Our Answere to their petition, Wee gaue them full
assurance that Wee would be as carefull of the preseruation of their
Priuiledges, as of Our owne Royall Prerogatiue; and in Our explanation
after sent vnto them by Our Letters, written to Our Secretary, We
told them that Wee neuer meant to denie them any lawful priuiledges
that euer that House enioyed in Our predecessours times; and that
whatsoeuer priuiledges or liberties they enioyed by any Law or Statute,
should euer bee inuiolably preserued by Vs; and We hoped Our posterity
would imitate Our footsteps therein; and whatsoeuer priuiledges they
enioyed by long custome, and vncontrolled and lawful Presidents, We
would likewise be as carefull to preserue them, and transmit the care
therof to Our posterity, confessing Our selues in iustice to be bound
to maintaine them in their Rights, and in grace, that We were rather
minded to increase, then infringe any of them, if they should so
deserue at Our hands, which might satisfie any reasonable man, that
We were farre from violating their priuiledges. And although by Our
Letters written to their Speaker, Wee aduised them to proceede, and
make this a Session, to the end, that Our good & louing subiects might
haue some taste, aswell of Our grace and goodnes towards them, by Our
free pardon and good Lawes to bee passed, as they had both by the great
and vnusuall examples of Iustice since this meeting, and the so many
eases and comforts giuen vnto them by Proclamation. And although We had
giuen order for the Pardon to goe on, and that in a more gracious and
liberall manner then hath passed in may yeeres before, and signified
Our willingnesse, that rather then time should bee misspent, they
might lay aside the thought of the Subsidie, and goe on with an Act
for continuance of Statutes, and the generall Pardon; yet all this
preuailed not to satisfie them, either for their pretended Priuiledges,
or to perswade them to proceed with Bils for the good of themselues,
and those that sent them. But as the Session and Pardon were by them
well desired at first; so were they as ill reiected at the last; and
notwithstanding the sinceritie of Our protestations, not to inuade
their Priuiledges; yet by the perswasion of such as had beene the
cause of all these distempers, they fall to carue for themselues, and
pretending causelesly to bee occasioned thereunto, in an vnseasonable
houre of the day, and a very thinne House, contrary to their owne
Custome in all matters of waight, conclude, and enter a protestation
for their liberties, in such ambiguous and generall words, as might
serue for future times to inuade most of Our inseparable Rights and
Prerogatiues, annexed to Our Imperiall Crowne: whereof not onely in the
times of other Our Progenitors, but in the blessed Raigne of Our late
Predecessor, that renowned Queene =ELIZABETH=, Wee found Our Crowne
actually possessed; an vsurpation that the Maiesty of a King can by no
meanes endure. By all which may appeare, that howsoeuer in the generall
proceedings of that House, there are many footsteps of louing and well
affected duetie to Vs: yet some ill tempered spirits haue sowed tares
among the corne, and thereby frustrated the hope of that plentifull and
good haruest, which might haue multiplyed the wealth and welfare of
this whole land; and by their cunning diuersions haue imposed vpon Vs a
necessitie of discontinuing this present Parliament, without putting
vnto it the name or period of a Session.

And therefore, whereas the said Assembly of Parliament was by Our
Commission adiourned vntill the eight day of February now next
ensuring, Wee, minding not to continue the same any longer, and
therfore not holding it fit to cause the Prelates, Noblemen, and States
of this Our Realm, or the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses of the
same Parliament to trauaile thereabout, haue thought fit to signifie
this Our resolution, with the reasons thereof vnto all Our Subiects,
inhabiting in all parts of this Realme, willing and requiring the said
Prelates, Noblemen and States, and also the said Knights, Citizens, and
Burgesses, and all others, to whom in this case it shall appertaine,
that they forbeare to attend at the day and place prefixed by the
said adiournement; and in so doing, they are and shall bee hereby
discharged thereof against Vs. And Wee doe hereby further declare, that
the said Conuention of Parliament, neither is, nor after the ceasing
and breaking thereof shall bee, nor ought to bee esteemed, adiudged, or
taken to be, or make any Session or Parliament.

And albeit Wee are at this time enforced to breake off this Conuention
of Parliament: yet Our will and desire is, that all Our subiects should
take notice, for auoyding of all sinister suspicions and iealousies,
that Our intent and full resolution is, to gouerne Our people in the
same manner, as Our Progenitors and Predecessours, Kings and Queenes
of this Realme, of best gouernment, haue heretofore done; and that Wee
shall be carefull, both in Our owne person, and by charging Our Priuie
Counsell, Our Iudges, and other Our Ministers in their seuerall places
respectiuely, to distribute true Iustice and right vnto all Our people;
and that Wee shall bee as glad to lay hold of the first occasion in due
and conuenient time, which Wee hope shall not bee long, to Call and
Assemble Our Parliament, with confidence of the true and hearty loue
and affection of Our subiects, as either Wee, or any of Our Progenitors
haue beene at any time heretofore.


 Giuen at Our Pallace at Westminster,
     the sixth day of Ianuary, in the
     nineteenth yeere of Our Reigne
     of Great Britaine, France, and
     Ireland.


           God saue the King.
