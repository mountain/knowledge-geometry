Natural History of the Brush Mouse (Peromyscus boylii) in Kansas With
Description of a New Subspecies

BY

CHARLES A. LONG


In order to determine the geographic distribution of the brush mouse in
the state, 15 localities, chosen on the basis of suitable habitat, were
investigated by means of snap-trapping in the winter and spring of 1959,
spring of 1960, and winter and spring of 1961. Variation in specimens
obtained by me and in other specimens in the Museum of Natural History,
The University of Kansas, was analyzed. Captive mice from Cherokee
County, Kansas, were observed almost daily from March 27, 1960, to June
1, 1961. Captive mice from Chautauqua and Cowley counties were studied
briefly. Contents of 38 stomachs of brush mice were analyzed, and
diet-preferences of the captive mice were studied. Data from
live-trapping and from snap-trapping are combined and provide some
knowledge of size and fluctuation of populations in the species.

Examination of the accumulated specimens and the captive mice reveals
the occurrence in southern Kansas of an unnamed subspecies, which may be
named and described as follows:

     #Peromyscus boylii cansensis# new subspecies

     _Type._--Male, adult, skin and skull; No. 81830, K. U.; from 4
     mi. E Sedan, Chautauqua County, Kansas; obtained on December
     30, 1959, by C. A. Long, original No. 456.

     _Range._--Known from 3 mi. W Cedar Vale, _in_ Cowley County,
     Kansas, and from the type locality.

     _Diagnosis._--Size medium (see Table 1 beyond); underparts
     white; upper parts Ochraceous-Tawny laterally, becoming
     intermixed with black and approaching Mummy Brown dorsally
     (capitalized color terms after Ridgway, 1912); eye
     nonprotuberant; tail short but well-haired distally and
     usually less than half total length; nasals long; cranium
     large.

_Comparisons._--From _P. b. attwateri_, the subspecies geographically
nearest _cansensis_, the latter can be easily distinguished by the less
protuberant eyes and relatively shorter tail (91 per cent of length of
head and body; in topotypes of _P. b. attwateri_ from Kerr County,
Texas, 104 per cent; in specimens of _P. b. attwateri_ from Cherokee
County, Kansas, 103 per cent). _P. b. cansensis_ is darker than _P. b.
attwateri_ and darker than _P. b. rowleyi_, the palest subspecies of
brush mouse, which occurs to the westward. The skull and nasals (see
Table 1) in adults of _P. b. attwateri_ from Cherokee County average
shorter than in _cansensis_.

     _Specimens examined._--Total, 26. _Cowley Co._: 3 mi. W Cedar
     Vale, 16. _Chautauqua Co._: type locality, 10.

(1909:148).]


_Distribution of Peromyscus boylii in Kansas_

The subspecies _Peromyscus boylii attwateri_ is known in the state only
from Cherokee County, the southeasternmost county in the state. Probably
the only locality where the brush mouse occurs in that county is on the
systems of cliffs along Shoal Creek, southward from Galena, to the
eastward of Baxter Springs. This is the extent of the known range, and
in my opinion the probable range, of _P. b. attwateri_ in the state (see
Fig. 1). Cockrum (1952:fig. 49) by mistake mapped the species from west
of Baxter Springs in Cherokee County.

Osgood (1909:149) recorded the subspecies _P. b. attwateri_ from Cedar
Vale, Chautauqua County, Kansas, but the specimen from there must now be
assigned to _cansensis_ on geographic grounds. Probably the specimen was
not obtained from Cedar Vale itself for the habitat is not suitable
there. Numerous specimens are known from 3 mi. W Cedar Vale, _in_ Cowley
County, Kansas, all of which are assigned to _cansensis_. Osgood's
recorded locality is situated between this locality and the type
locality of _cansensis_, which is 4 mi. E Sedan, Chautauqua County,
Kansas. The distribution of _cansensis_ also is shown in Fig. 1.

[Illustration: FIG. 1. Distribution of the brush mouse in Kansas. The
southernmost row of counties includes from left to right Cowley,
Chautauqua, Montgomery, Labette, and Cherokee. Black dots represent
trapping localities from which brush mice were not obtained. Triangles
represent localities from which brush mice were obtained. The stippled
area contains suitable habitat for the brush mouse, but was not
investigated. The easternmost triangle represents a place 2 mi. S
Galena, Cherokee Co., Kansas, from which _P. b. attwateri_ is known. The
westernmost triangle represents a place 3 mi. W Cedar Vale, _in_ Cowley
Co., Kansas, from which _P. b. cansensis_ is known. The triangle of
intermediate position represents the type locality of _P. b. cansensis_,
a place 4 mi. E Sedan, Chautauqua Co., Kansas. Many of the trapping
localities have been investigated more than once.]

The probable geographic range of _P. boylii_ is based on trapping data
(see Fig. 1). The brush mouse is confined to systems of wooded cliffs in
Kansas. The two subspecies seem to be separated by more than 80 miles of
grasslands. Blair (1959) has postulated that in the northeastern part of
its range _P. b. attwateri_ is represented by disjunct, relict
populations formed by diminishing montane or cool, moist environmental
conditions. He has implied that the critical climatic change occurred
during post-Wisconsin times, and that the isolation of these populations
occurred so recently that no morphological differentiation has resulted
in them. Inasmuch as the species is widely distributed in México, the
southwestern United States, and in California, and has been recorded
from the Pleistocene of California (Hay, 1927:323), it is reasonable to
suppose that the species immigrated into Kansas from the southwest and
that the immigration was in a generally northward or eastward direction.
If long tail and large eyes are specializations for a scansorial mode of
life (discussed below), then _P. b. cansensis_ must be considered more
primitive than _P. b. attwateri_ for the eyes are less protuberant and
the tail is shorter in _P. b. cansensis_ than in the latter. I suggest
that _P. b. cansensis_ occurred in what is now known as Kansas before
_P. b. attwateri_ entered this area by way of the Ozark Mountains. The
occurrence of a mouse of "the _truei_ or _boylei_ group" (Hibbard,
1955:213) in southwestern Kansas in the Jinglebob interglacial fauna of
the Pleistocene adds little to support the thesis outlined above, but is
not inconsistent with the thesis. Incidentally, the geographic
distribution of _P. boylii_ may differ somewhat from that shown by Blair
(1959:fig. 5); whereas he has mapped the distribution of _P. boylii_ to
show disjunctivity in _P. b. attwateri_ and homogeneity in the
distribution of other subspecies of the brush mouse to the westward and
southward, disjunctivity actually occurs frequently also in the western
and southern subspecies.


_Ecology_

In Kansas the brush mouse is confined to systems of cliffs, the faces of
which range in height to at least 40 feet. The highest cliffs--some
approximately 100 feet--on which brush mice are known to occur in Kansas
are along Shoal Creek, Cherokee County. The brush mouse is found on low
bluffs that are parts of higher systems, but in Cherokee County the
mouse was not obtained from low bluffs separated by even a few miles
from the cliff-system along Shoal Creek. As implied above the brush
mouse is adapted for a scansorial mode of life; but other mice and rats
inhabit the rocky crevices of low bluffs. Whereas the brush mouse is
well adapted for living on high cliffs it seems that the other rodents
are better adapted for life on low cliffs. _Sigmodon hispidus_ was
obtained from the low, limestone cliffs mentioned previously. From most
low bluffs in southeastern Kansas (and on some high bluffs outside the
geographic range of _cansensis_) _Peromyscus leucopus_ was obtained. In
Cowley County the brush mouse was abundant when _P. leucopus_ was not
and _vice versa_ during this study. _Sigmodon hispidus_ did not
associate with the brush mouse in any area, although _S. hispidus_ was
often trapped in grassy areas adjacent to cliffs and on the grassy
crests of the hills. Except at the locality in Cherokee County, the pack
rat, _Neotoma floridana_, was found in association with the brush mouse.
_Microtus ochrogaster_ was the must abundant rodent in adjacent
southwestern Missouri (Jackson, 1907) before _Sigmodon_ thoroughly
infiltrated this area and southeastern Kansas. Activities of other
rodents may have confined the brush mouse ecologically to cliffs.
Although the grasslands are a barrier to further intrusion by the brush
mouse into Kansas, one cannot assume that they alone confined the brush
mouse to cliffs. Such an assumption would not explain its absence on
systems of cliffs similar to and near other systems of cliffs on which
it is found in the non-grassy Ozarkian habitats of Arkansas, as was
noticed by Black (1937). Such an assumption would not indicate why the
size of the cliff-systems is correlated with the absence or presence of
the brush mouse on the northeastern margin of its geographic range.

Parasites found on _P. b. attwateri_ include three individuals of the
laelapid mite, _Haemolaelaps glasgowi_. Two of these mites were removed
from a live mouse. Two larval Ixodid ticks, _Ixodes_ possibly _cookei_,
were removed from the pinnae of the ears of a specimen of _cansensis_
from the type locality, 4 mi. E Sedan, Chautauqua County. Four larval
Ixodid ticks, _Dermacentor_ possibly _variabilis_, were removed from the
pinnae of the ears of a live specimen of _cansensis_ from 3 mi. W Cedar
Vale, in Cowley County.

[Footnote B: Judged to be acorn pulp or hickory nut pulp.]

Black (1937:195) and Cockrum (1952:180-181) reported stomach contents
of _P. b. attwateri_ from Cherokee County containing acorn pulp, seeds,
and insects. Analysis of 38 stomachs of the brush mouse (Table 2) show
acorns to be the most commonly used food in winter and spring. Seed
coats were only rarely found, and insects were absent. Two captive
females preferred acorns. Live beetles and grasshoppers of numerous
kinds were decapitated and their inner parts eaten. Seeds (wheat, corn,
and oats) were also eaten. Inasmuch as acorns appear to be the chief
food, it is not surprising that the brush mouse is usually found on
cliffs that support stands of blackjack oak (_Quercus marilandica_).
Other oaks are present, but I have no evidence that the brush mouse eats
their acorns. A. Metcalf told me that he observed in December, 1960, a
released brush mouse interrupt its movement toward a hole in a
cliff-face along Cedar Creek, Cowley County, in order to pick up an
acorn (judged to be from the blackjack oak) in daylight. The mouse
carried the acorn into the hole in the cliff. I have observed that
captive brush mice eat acorns of the blackjack oak but not some other
kinds of acorns.


_Behavior_

The chief differences observed between the brush mouse and other species
of the genus _Peromyscus_ in Kansas can be summarized as follows: the
brush mouse is a superior and more cautious climber; seldom jumps from
high places when under stress; is capable of finding its way better in
partial darkness; has a stronger preference for acorns; and sometimes
buries or hides seeds or acorns. These are all behavioral adaptations
that seem in harmony with its mode of life.

Buck, Tolman, and Tolman (1925) showed the balancing function of the
tail in _Mus musculus_. Climbers (for example, squirrels) often possess
long, well-haired tails. It is reasonable to suggest (as did Hall,
1955:134) that the long, tufted tail is an adaptation for a scansorial
existence. Little observation is necessary to observe how such a tail is
used in balancing. Furthermore, it is used as a prop when the mouse is
climbing a vertical surface. Dalquest (1955:144) mentioned tree-climbing
in _P. boylii_ from San Luis Potosí, México. It may occur in _P. b.
attwateri_ or in _P. b. cansensis_ also, but there is no evidence as yet
to prove it.

The brush mouse can seldom be induced to jump from heights of two feet
or more. Rather it tends to scamper downward or to remain in place. It
often swings itself over an edge, holding to it by its hind feet, and
sometimes to it lightly with its tail, and reduces a short jump by
almost the length of its body. Such caution seems to be an adaptation in
a mouse that lives as a climber.

Many animals of cavernous habitats have small eyes (see Dobzhansky,
1951:284). Some nocturnal animals (for example, owls) have large eyes.
The brush mouse has large, protuberant eyes; it lives in the deep
crevices and fissures of the cliffs on which it is found, but it is not
strictly a cave-dwelling animal. Perhaps large eyes aid the brush mouse
in performing activities in the partial darkness of a deep crevice or
hole in a cliff. Brush mice experimentally placed in what appeared to be
total darkness fed, built houses of cotton, and ran and climbed in the
usual manner.

On several occasions the captive brush mice hid surplus seeds and on
other occasions hid acorns by burying them and sometimes by placing them
in a small jar. The mice never carried the surplus food into their
house.

Black (1937:195) has claimed that the brush mouse builds a nest similar
to that of the nest of the pack rat, _Neotoma floridana_. Hall
(1955:134) doubts this to be the case. Dalquest (1953:144) described a
nest of _P. boylii_ from San Luis Potosí as seven inches in diameter,
made of leaves, and found in a hollow tree. Drake (1958:110) noted that
_P. b. rowleyi_ lives in holes and crevices in rocky bluffs in Durango,
México. I have found this to be the case for _P. b. attwateri_, as did
A. Metcalf (unpublished) for _P. b. cansensis_. Nests of sticks and
leaves were taken apart by Metcalf, and all sign indicated only the
presence of the pack rat. I have observed that there are no such houses
on the cliffs along Shoal Creek, Cherokee County, and that no pack rats
have been obtained from there (pack rats have not been reported from
Cherokee County). Blair (1938) found two brush mice (_P. b. attwateri_)
in the house of a pack rat in Oklahoma. Nests of the brush mice that
occur in Kansas have not been found.

A lactating, pregnant female (KU 81833) of _P. b. attwateri_, containing
three embryos, was obtained on December 24, 1959, and shows that this
subspecies breeds in winter. Accumulated records for the subspecies
indicates year-round breeding (see Cockrum, 1952:181). Another female
obtained on March 27, 1960, was probably lactating.

Pregnant females of _P. b. cansensis_ (KU 84892, 84895, and 84890) were
obtained from the type locality on April 1-2, 1961, containing 3, 4,
and 5 embryos respectively. This indicates, perhaps, increased breeding
in spring; five was the highest number of embryos found in brush mice in
Kansas.


_Population Studies_

In the period of my study the populations of brush mice became smaller,
perhaps owing to the severe winter of 1959-1960. In Cowley County, _P.
leucopus_ is now abundant and _P. boylii_ rare where in December of
1959, the opposite was true. It is also possible, of course, that
trapping has depleted the populations.


Conclusions

   1. A new subspecies of brush mouse is named and described from
      southern Kansas.

   2. The new subspecies has smaller eyes and a shorter tail and may
      be more primitive than _P. b. attwateri_.

   3. No significant sexual dimorphism was noted in _P. boylii_.

   4. In Kansas, _P. b. attwateri_ is known only from a single
      locality; _P. b. cansensis_ is known from only two localities,
      both in Kansas.

   5. The cliff-dwelling habit of _P. boylii_ probably isolates
      populations from one another.

   6. The grasslands constitute a barrier for the brush mouse.

   7. In Kansas, _P. b. cansensis_ probably is an older population
      than _P. b. attwateri_.

   8. In Kansas the brush mouse is confined to systems of cliffs
      that are wooded and that are at least 40 feet in height.

   9. The brush mouse may be confined to cliffs in part by
      activities of other rodents.

  10. The brush mouse commonly associates with the pack rat.

  11. Laelapid mites have been found on specimens of _P. b.
      attwateri_.

  12. Larval ixodid ticks were found on specimens of _P. b.
      cansensis_.

  13. Acorns seem to be the chief food of the brush mouse; insects
      and seeds are also commonly eaten.

  14. The brush mouse is adapted for climbing and probably for a
      partly subterranean life.

  15. _P. b. attwateri_ breeds in winter, as well as in other parts
      of the year.

  16. _P. b. cansensis_ is known to breed in early April.

  17. The highest number of embryos obtained from a brush mouse in
      Kansas is five.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
