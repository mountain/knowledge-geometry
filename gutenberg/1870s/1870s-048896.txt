          "A souldier without arms may be valiant, but not
          victorious; an artizan without his instruments may
          be skillful but not famous; ... To aim at learning
          without bookes is with Danaides, to draw water in a
          sieve." --R. WILLIAMS, 1630.

                               PREFACE.

This _brochure_ owes its existence to Mr. Power's _Handy Book about
Books_, a large portion of which was reproduced in the American
_Bibliopolist_. An examination of so much as Mr. Power had done on the
subject of bibliography, led me to the conclusion that he had not made
a personal examination of the books described, and that the eminent
individuals, whom he thanks as having rendered him valuable assistance,
must have had rather limited bibliographical resources; indeed, the
general result was so disappointing that I determined to endeavor an
improvement, and the result is the present list which is about four
times the extent of Mr. Power's, and includes all the titles quoted
by him, some of which we should have preferred to omit. Still it is
not a complete bibliography, for the most excellent reason that such a
work is beyond any one man's capacity; but it is hoped it will prove
useful to those librarians and general readers who desire information
concerning books about books.

Those who seek further information on the subject may consult with
much advantage Petzholdt's _Bibliotheca Bibliographica_, which is
conspicuous for the faithful and painstaking care exhibited in its
compilation, and in which the titles are treated with that minute
attention to classification which is preëminently the characteristic of
the German mind, while our list is conspicuous for the absence of any
attempt at such a classification.

I cannot close this brief notice without tendering my thanks to
Mr. Charles A. Cutter of the Boston Athenæum for his valuable aid.
When librarians in general can approach his standard of library
intelligence, there will cease to be that plentiful lack of knowledge
by which some of them are now distinguished.

                                                JOSEPH SABIN.

     "Truly the _American Bibliographical Dictionary_. Notices of 6,775
     American names."--_Guild's Librarian's Manual._ It is difficult to
     believe that Mr. Guild really knew what he was writing about when
     he penned this note. The work is _not_ bibliographical in a proper
     sense, and in the matter of biography it is confined mainly to New
     England clergymen. It might be omitted from this list without loss.

     both American and English now living."--POWER. Rather clumsily

     Dr. Dibdin's edition, it does also contain an account of all the
     English books printed abroad, and of those printed in Scotland and
     Ireland, which the following edition does not. Also on large paper.

 vols., folio.                             _Matriti: J. Ibarræ._ 1783-8.

     "An excellent edition, the _Bibliotheca Vetus_ being enriched with
     notes by Perez Bayer, a learned Valencian, the _Bibliotheca Nova_
     receiving additions from Antonio's own manuscripts, that bring down
     his notices of Spanish writers to the time of his death in 1684. In
     the earlier portion, embracing the names of about 1,300 authors,
     little remains to be desired. The latter portion contains notices
     of nearly 8,000 writers--it is a monument of industry, firmness,
     and fidelity. The two, taken together, constitute their author
     beyond all reasonable question, the father and founder of the
     literary history of his country."--TICKNOR, I. 218. Further details
     concerning this will be found in Dibdin's _Bibliomania_ and Sabin's
     _Dictionary_, Vol. I. 226-227. There are copies on large paper.

     Although it bears the name of the publishers, it it well known to
     have been the work of a paid compiler [Mr. Delf?]; it is very well
     done.

     Also on large paper. Many copies are imperfect, terminating
     abruptly on page 120. Numbers up to this point had been
     delivered to the publisher's American agent; the agent failed,
     and the delivery was not completed; the book thereafter being

     A very amusing performance, filled with anecdotes and characters of
     the author's literary contemporaries. The first edition contains

     The second volume consists of a catalogue of works intended for the

     José Rafael Enriquez Trespalacios Beristain, Sobrino del Autor.
     _Officina de D. Alexandra Valdéz._ 1819." "De Souza is by far
     the most important work for the literature of New Spain that has
     ever been composed. It comprises 3,687 biographies, and although
     like most Spanish works of the kind, singularly uncritical, yet
     it is a perfect treasure as regards the cultivation of science
     and literature in Mexico and the adjacent countries. The work
     is extremely scarce, and appears to be altogether unknown in
     Europe."--LUDEWIG. See also [Harrisse] _Bib. Am. Vet._, pp. xx,
     xxi. Señor Icazbalceta, of the city of Mexico, announced a new
     edition, but I believe it has not been published.

 Bibliotheca Americana; or a Chronological Catalogue of Books,
 Pamphlets, State Papers, &c., upon the Subject of North and South
 America. With an Introductory Discourse on the Present State of
 Literature in those Countries. [By H. Homer.] 4to.      _London._ 1789.

     This book, which has been variously ascribed to Dalrymple, Homer,
     Long, and with more probability, by Homer himself, to Reid, was
     the fullest English work on the subject up to its date; but
     its complicated arrangements, errors of date, unintelligible
     abbreviations, and frequent repetitions mar its utility. Some of
     the remarks in the introduction are curious, if not true. The
     errata, if all printed, would fill a dozen pages. See _M. Rev._,
     II. 474; Rich, I. 354.

     Only thirty copies of this complete list of Caxton's books were
     printed for sale; of which number fifteen were sent to America.

                      _Paris: Treuttel et Würtz, et à Strasbourg._ 1808.

     In the matter of dates and titles very incorrect, but valuable for
     the extracts it contains from the voyages of the last century. Vol.
     VI. relates to America. Dibdin pronounces it "an indispensable
     performance," in which judgment we do not agree.

 BOULARD (S.) Traité Élémentaire de Bibliographie.... 8vo, pp. (4), 140.

     No more published. "The conclusion, showing the present state of
     the Protestant religion in Maryland," etc., occupies pp. 125-130.
     The author states that the object of this bibliographical treatise
     was to give those who went to Virginia, Maryland, and the American

 BRIDGMAN (R. W.) A Short View of Legal Bibliography, containing some
 Critical Observations on the Authority of the Reporters and other

 Waley Bridgman. 8vo, pp. xviii, 430.                    _London._ 1807.

     Though this work is of an early date it will be found of interest
     to the law student. It has the advantage of two good indexes, one
     of authors, and the other a classified list of subjects.

 printed]. Folio.                                        _London._ 1841.

     It is scarcely necessary to remark that, practically, there is
     no printed catalogue of the library of the British Museum, and
     apparently there never will be. The manuscript catalogue fills a
     room about 30 feet square.

 BRÜGGEMANN (L. W.) A View of the English Editions, Translations, and
 Illustrations of the Greek and Latin Authors. With Remarks, By Lewis

     This is an entirely new edition of this invaluable bibliographical
     work, very much enlarged and improved, and elegantly printed on
     fine paper. "On the whole, the most useful and instructive work we
     possess in this branch of bibliography (_restricted_)."--EBERT:
     Preface to the English edition of _Allgem. Bib. p. v._ Fifty copies
     printed on large paper. It is probably the only bibliographical
     work which reached a fifth edition during its author's lifetime.

     Only seventy-five copies printed. But the sets having been issued
     at different places, it is probable that not over fifty were made
     complete. "Whoever is desirous to collect a library of various and
     solid erudition, will find very useful aid in the Res Literariæ."

 BRYDGES. Restituta; or, Titles, Extracts, and Characters of Old Books,

     Mr. White, in his Prefatory Note, says: The following desultory
     dissertation on books, book-collecting, and book-collectors,
     cannot fail to be welcome, for it is always interesting, often
     serviceable, and sometimes amusing information.

     This work must ever be highly valued as affording the only complete
     index to the rich repertory of Arabian Manuscripts in the Escurial,
     and for the ample evidence which it exhibits of the science and
     mental culture of the Spanish Arabs. Gibbon remarks: "The execution
     of this work does honour to the Spanish press. The MSS., to the
     number of 1851, are judiciously classified by the Editor, and his
     copious extracts throw some light on the Mahommedan literature and
     history of Spain."

     that edition are placed in their proper positions. The "Index,"
     also, is greatly enlarged. This valuable and interesting work is,
     in fact, an extended edition of the author's catalogue of the Duke
     of Bridgewater's library. It describes books which, for the most
     part, are so scarce, that but few American libraries possess them;
     and Mr. Collier has performed an acceptable office in quoting

     the first four folio editions of Shakespeare, as also for the very
     rare first quarto editions of his plays, have never been surpassed.
     This sale marks an era for the sale and the prices of early English
     literature.

     civilization. Those who come in from a walk on a cold winter's day
     are here cautioned to use a kerchief ere they presume to look at a
     rare book, and also to avoid having books opened during meals.

 Parts. Illustrated with Cuts. By the Rev. Thomas Frognall Dibdin. 8vo,
 pp. ix, (2), 782, (1).          _London: Printed for the Author._ 1811.

     Of this edition eighteen copies only were printed on large paper.

 DIBDIN. Bibliomania; or Book-Madness; A Bibliographical Romance.
 Illustrated with Cuts. By Thomas Frognall Dibdin, D.D. New and Improved
 Edition ... including a Key to the assumed characters in the Drama.
 Medium 8vo.                            _London: H. G. Bohn._ MDCCCXLII.

     This edition was undertaken by Mr. Walmsly. It contains a key
     to the characters, etc., and a supplement, edited by Dr. Dibdin
     himself. The copies on large paper, imp. 8vo, have titles-pages for
     two volumes.

     "The _Bibliomania_ is written in dialogues or conversations,
     the characters introduced are well-known book collectors of the
     author's acquaintance. The great value of the work is in the notes,
     which abound with anecdotes of books and book collectors, and an
     account of the rarer articles in their collections, and the prices
     at which they were sold, extracted from the sale catalogues. It
     will be always consulted as an authority."--LOWNDES.

     "The _Bibliomania_ is evidently formed in the first instance on the
     plan of honest Isaac Walton's _Complete Angler_; with conspicuous
     marks of the author's being deeply versed in the _Battle of the
     Books_, and a familiar acquaintance with old English literature,
     and occasionally with the discussions of Yorick. Under the shape
     of dramatic dialogue, the reader is equally entertained, and
     instructed; the abstruser parts, with the historic details, being
     thrown into the form of notes. It would now be useless to pass an
     encomium on this work, as its merits are so fully established as
     to have more than doubled the original price of a volume now with
     difficulty to be obtained."--_Gent's. Magazine._

     "You have contrived to strew flowers over a path which, in other
     hands, would have proved a very dull one; and all Bibliomanes must
     remember you long, as he who first united their antiquarian details
     with good-humored raillery and cheerfulness."--SIR WALTER SCOTT TO
     DR. DIBDIN.

 DIBDIN. Book Rarities; or a Descriptive Catalogue of some of the
 most Curious, Rare, and Valuable Books of Early Date; Chiefly in the
 Collection of the Right Honourable George John Earl Spencer, K.G., &c.,

                              _London: Printed by W. Bulmer & Co._ 1811.

     Very rare; thirty-six copies only printed, not published. "The
     Foundation Stone of the _Bibliotheca Spenceriana_."--DIBDIN.

 DIBDIN. Lincolne Nosegay, a brefe Table of Certaine Bokes in the
 possession of Maister Dibdin, Clerk. Post 8vo, pp. 16. _London._ [1811.]

     Very rare; only thirty-six copies having been printed. Contains
     descriptions of nineteen books then in the author's possession,
     but which afterwards passed into the libraries of Heber and Earl
     Spencer.

     Very rare; fifty copies only privately printed, not published, the
     greater part of which were destroyed by the author. "There is no
     title-page to this effusion from the pen of Dr. Dibdin."--MARTIN.

 DIBDIN. Bibliotheca Spenceriana; or a Descriptive Catalogue of the
 Books printed in the Fifteenth Century, and of many Valuable First
 Editions, in the Library of George John Earl Spencer, K.G., etc.,
 etc., etc. By the Reverend Thomas Frognall Dibdin. 4 vols., imp. 8vo.
                              _London: Printed for the Author._ 1814-15.

     Fifty copies were printed on large paper. "This catalogue contains
     only the works printed in the fifteenth century and the Editiones
     Principes. It is compiled with the greatest care and industry, and
     those who have had occasion to consult its pages, can testify to
     its accuracy and great utility. It is the finest private collection
     in Europe; the catalogue will ever be regarded as of the first
     importance to the theologian, the historian, and the critic, and as
     a perfect model for the bibliographer."--LOWNDES.

 DIBDIN. The Bibliographical Decameron; or, Ten Days Pleasant Discourse
 upon Illuminated Manuscripts, and Subjects connected with Early
 Engravings, Typography, and Bibliography. By the Rev. T. F. Dibdin. 3
 vols., rl. 8vo.                 _London: Printed for the Author._ 1817.

     Also on large paper, 3 vols., imp. 8vo. "This work may be
     considered as a continuation of the _Bibliomania_, the same
     characters being introduced in the dialogues. From the information
     which it contains, and the splendor of the decorations and
     printing, it will ever be considered as a model of excellence and
     good taste in typography and the arts."

 DIBDIN. Ædes Althorpianæ; or an Account of the Mansion, Books, and
 Pictures, at Althorp; the Residence of George John Earl Spencer, K.G.
 To which is added a Supplement to the Bibliotheca Spenceriana. By the

                                         _London: Payne and Foss._ 1822.

     _See_ the author's _Reminiscences_, II. 557-94, for the interesting
     account of the publication of this work, where it appears that
     the cost of engraving the portraits was upwards of £2,000. It was
     designed as a supplement to the _Bibliotheca Spenceriana_, and
     contains accounts of the ancestors of Earl Spencer; of the Mansion
     at Althorp; of the gallery, with engravings of the most important
     pictures; and of editions of the Scriptures, Aldine editions, and
     books printed in the fifteenth century, not contained in the former
     volumes.

 DIBDIN. A Descriptive Catalogue of the Books printed in the Fifteenth
 Century, lately forming Part of the Library of the Duke Di Cassano
 Serra, and now the Property of George John Earl Spencer, K.G. With a
 General Index of Authors and Editions contained in the Present Volume,
 and in the Bibliotheca Spenceriana and Ædes Althorpianæ. By the Rev.
 Thomas Frognall Dibdin. Imp. 8vo, pp. x, 295.

     Also on large paper, 3 vols., imp. 8vo. "This work contains much
     curious information respecting the MSS. and rare works in public
     and private libraries abroad. It is printed and embellished in the
     same style of excellence as the Doctor's other works."--LOWNDES.

     "A work calculated to have as intoxicating an effect on the
     imagination of literary antiquaries, as the adventures of the
     heroes of the Round Table on all true knights, or the tales
     of the early American voyagers on the ardent spirits of their
     age. It has not passed, however, without some hostile (though
     unfounded) remarks from the printers, binders, and librarians of
     France."--WRANGHAM.

 DIBDIN. A Bibliographical Antiquarian and Picturesque Tour in France
 and Germany. By the Reverend Thomas Frognall Dibdin, D.D. The Second
 Edition. 3 vols., 8vo, pp. (4), xliii, (2), 421, Portraits, Plates;
 (4), iv, 428; (4), iv, 481.                _London: R. Jennings._ 1829.

     This edition omits some of the plates contained in the first, but
     has others which are not in that. It is esteemed for its preface,
     28 pp., in which the author summarily disposes of Crapelet,
     Licquet, and Lesné.

 [DIBDIN.] Lettre Neuvième relative à la Bibliothèque de Rouen, traduite
 de l'Anglais, avec des Notes par T. Licquet, Conservateur de cette

     Also on large paper. One hundred copies only printed; very rare.

     Only one hundred copies printed; the notes and preface, which
     contain so much that is "silly" and "scurrilous," drew from Dr.
     Dibdin the following reply, _A Roland for an Oliver_.

 DIBDIN. A Roland for an Oliver; or, Brief Remarks upon the Preface and
 Notes of G. A. Crapelet, attached to his Translation of the Thirtieth
 Letter of the Bibliographical, Antiquarian, and Picturesque Tour. By
 the Author of that Town. Imp. 8vo.                      _London._ 1821.

     Of this excessively rare morceau, the rarest perhaps of all Dr.
     Dibdin's works, only thirty-six copies were privately printed.

 DIBDIN. [First Thoughts. Corrected Proof Sheets of the Tour in France
 and Germany.] Imp. 8vo.

     It is very curious, consisting of a number of proof-sheets of the
     Foreign Bibliographical Tour, with numerous alterations, remarks,
     &c., &c. These sheets are called First Thoughts, became the text in
     the published work varies considerably from these sheets.

 DIBDIN. The Library Companion; or, the Young Man's Guide, and the Old
 Man's Comfort, in the Choice of a Library. By the Rev. T. F. Dibdin.
 2 vols., 8vo, pp. (4), li, (1), 400; (1), 401-912.
                                           _London: Harding._ MDCCCXXIV.

     Also on large paper, imp. 8vo. From an anecdote recorded at page
     394 of this edition, concerning "certain buckskins," in the edition
     of 1823, and which is omitted in the subsequent ones, that acquired
     the title of the "Breeches Edition."

     "It contains much curious and important bibliographical information
     not elsewhere to be found, and will at all times be consulted,
     as a work of reference, by the bibliographer, biographer, and
     historian."--LOWNDES.

     whom it may concern." "Fear is the order of the day. To those
     very natural and long established fears of Bailiffs and Tax

     Books."--page 6. Some copies have a Key to the names of the various
     characters mentioned in the work.

                         _London: Printed for the Author._ MDCCCXXXVIII.

     Also on large paper, in 3 vols., imp. 8vo. In this work the author
     concluded his tours. It it an essential companion to the tour in
     France and Germany; and, as it describes some collections that have
     ceased to exist, possesses an historical interest.

     One hundred copies printed on large paper. "The nicknacks of
     literature collected in Mr. Disraeli's cabinet were selected from
     sources not generally accessible to ordinary readers. These volumes
     are not only admirably adapted to minister to the amusement of
     the lounger and refined trifler, but they have higher capacities,
     as curious and authentic pictures of the manners of ruder times,
     and records of the progress of letters from their rise in the
     dark middle ages, to almost the present era." There is a French
     translation by T. P. Bertin, 2 vols., 8vo. _Paris._ 1810.

     The edition, "augmentée par Barbeau de la Bruyère et Drouet."
     _Paris: Tilliard._ 1768. 10 vols., 12mo, is considered the best.

     that of the Church to which he belonged."--ORME. _See_ Goujet,

     A few copies printed on large paper. Contains numerous engravings
     from early MSS., facsimiles of types, bookbinding etc. This
     important work was in preparation thirteen years. Neither France
     nor Germany can boast of a work treating the subjects with a
     similar comprehensiveness, and in England the work has certainly
     had no predecessor. "Of the industry bestowed upon this extensive
     compilation, and of the marvellous condensation of fact it
     supplies, it is difficult to speak in terms of proper commendation;
     even to the most accomplished bibliographer it cannot rail to be
     of great service, but how much more so to the tyro, or ordinary
     bibliographer."--BROWNSON'S _Review_.

             editioni ejusdem Bibliothecae destinatâ. Anno Domini_ 1755.

     Of this rare and valuable work Vol I. only was published. It
     contains the most authentic notes on the literature and literary
     men of Mexico, and became the basis of Beristain's celebrated
     _Bibl. Hisp. Amer._, which appeared sixty years later. Eguiara was
     one of the most talented members of the Academy of Mexico. "It is
     unfortunate that no more of this important work was published. It
     is probable that not many copies were printed of this volume, as
     it is not often met with."--RICH, 1. 115. The remainder of the
     manuscript was said to be preserved in the Library of the Cathedral
     of Mexico. Leclerc's collation seems to differ from ours. "Ouvrage
     curieux, mais dont il n'a paru que le premier volume."--BRUNET.

     they say, and therefore they ask Congress to levy a duty of 25
     cents a pound on English books, to protect them against the
     efforts of the English authors, who are making America an English
     colony by sending over at reasonable rates their own books for
     sale."--STEVENS.

     So far, the most extensive list of books on this subject. Mr.
     Field has devoted many years to the acquisition of the books, and
     his notes, which are numerous, convey much valuable information

     bibliographical handbook, embracing a collection of about 1800
     works, may be considered the chief, if not the only one of its
     kind. The author's notes are judicious and valuable, and have an
     interest beyond even the actual subject of the Essay. Collectors

     a labour that evinces a wide range of study and experience."--B.

     some of them there is appended such a statement as "Temple of the
     Muses," which is merely an advertising bait of the publishers.

     preface by Dr. S. Johnson, was issued in parts; the first two
     volumes in 1743, and two more in 1744. The last volume is not,
     properly, a part of the work, though issued under the same name.
     The books were not sold by auction, and the prices were not

 [HARRISSE (Henry).] Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima A Description
 of Works relating to America published between the Years 1492 and 1551
 Imp. 8vo, pp. (8), liv, 519.       _New-York Geo. P. Philes_, MDCCCLXVI

     Four hundred copies printed in imperial 8vo, one hundred and nine
     in 4to, ten of which are on Holland paper. It was undertaken at
     the suggestion of Mr. S. L. M. Barlow, of New York, and contains
     the titles of over three hundred books. As a specimen of American
     typography, it has probably never been surpassed. In regard to
     its merits it has received at the hands of some members of the
     Geographical Society of Paris very high praise, of which an
     English version (in part) will be found in Stevens' _Bibliotheca
     Historica_, followed by some rather severe criticism on the work
     by Mr. Stevens, who, writing in the third person, quotes largely
     from an article in the _Athenæum_ of the 6th of October, 1866, of
     which Mr. Stevens is the author. The writer of this notice does
     not presume to enter into a controversy with, or a criticism upon,
     the works of either of these bibliographers, but he cannot help
     regretting that a work so elaborate, learned, and useful to the
     American bibliographer, as this _Bibliotheca Americana_ is, should
     have been the vehicle of any exhibition of personal pique. We have
     been assured on very good authority that the blunder of "Ander
     Schiffahrt's" was really due to the proof-reader, and that the
     Index, in which Schiffahrt (Ander) is made to appear once more in
     _propria persona_, was not the work of Mr. Harrisse at all. Let it
     suffice for us to remark that for the student of the earliest of
     books relating to America, this book is indispensably necessary. We
     may add that Mr. Harrisse has, in some instances, quoted works from
     White Kennett's _Bibliothecæ Americanæ Primordia_, and made the
     remark that he has found nothing in the works so quoted relating to
     America. This has arisen from the fact that he has misapprehended
     the nature of that work, which purposely introduces many books
     which had no relation to America. The following is a continuation:

 relating to America published between the Years 1492 and 1551 Additions
 Imp. 8vo, pp. (iv), 40, 199, (1).  _Paris Librairie Tross_ M.DCCC.LXXII

     Two hundred copies printed in 8vo, and fifty copies in 4to. In the
     matter of printing and paper this volume exceeds in beauty that of
     its predecessor. Its contents cover the same ground; some titles
     contained in the former work are further elaborated, and many are
     entirely new. It will, perhaps, not be saying too much that many of
     them are only remotely related to America, but the author's careful
     researches and elaborate dissertations have combined to render the
     volume a very desirable addition to an American bibliographical
     collection.

     Two hundred and fifty copies printed, of which twenty-five are on
     Whatman's paper.

     Ninety copies only printed for presentation, at the expense of
     Samuel L. M. Barlow, of New York. It is one of the finest specimens
     of printing by the Riverside Press, and having been privately
     printed, is as rare as it is beautiful. It is both bibliographical
     and historical, and in each department is a specimen of seal and
     erudition.

     This is a capital resumé of the Bibliography of Canada up to
     1700. The volume is very handsomely printed; some copies are on
     vellum paper, and others on Dutch paper. The following should have
     appeared under Desjardins: "Rapports sur les Deux Ouvrages de

 Engravings.                                    _London: Longman._ 1829.

     Twenty-five copies printed in imperial 8vo on large vellum paper.
     The original letters in this volume form a very interesting portion
     of its contents. Those of Ciofanus are filled with abuse of Aldus
     Junior, whom he terms _la Cornacchia Esopea_, and of whose literary
     ability he speaks very slightingly. It also includes a reprint of
     _Capell's Shakesperiana_.

     This amusing bibliographical squib is written by "Carolus Henricus
     Hartshorne," in whose hand the memorandum of the number of copies
     printed is given on the fly-leaf. It appears from this that
     only twenty were printed, and probably in a private manner for
     presentation. The spelling and printing are equally ancient in
     style, and the whole discourse, ending with the poem, runs upon
     black letter and other antique lore.

     Probably the first catalogue of a public library printed in North
     America. A select catalogue was printed for undergraduates in 1773,

     The first edition or sale catalogue of this library was
     characterised by the auctioneer as "The most Perfect, Genuine,
     Learned, and Useful Library of Books ever offered to the British
     Public." After the sale a few copies were issued on large paper,
     with the prices and purchasers' names printed to each title. 8vo,

     Add to the note: a few copies were printed on large and thick

     figures as "Atticus" in Dibdin's _Bibliomania_, the first edition
     of which is in the form of an Epistle addressed to him.

     of the catalogues.

 HUMPHREYS (H. N.) A History of the Art of Printing, from its Invention
 to its wide-spread Development in the Middle of the 16th Century.
 Preceded by a Short Account of the Origin of the Alphabet, and of the
 successive Methods of Recording Events and Multiplying Ms. Books before
 the Invention of Printing. By H. Noel Humphreys.... With One Hundred
 Illustrations.... Imp. 4to, pp. 224. 105 Plates.
                                       _London: Bernard Quaritch._ 1867.

     The first issue consisted of three hundred copies only. The
     publisher's certificate to that effect is usually inserted in the
     work. "The illustrations of this work, which, unlike facsimiles
     produced by hand, must _necessarily_ be absolute reproductions
     of their originals, exceed one hundred in number, and frequently
     consist of representations of entire pages from many of the most
     interesting books produced by the early printers. Among them
     may be mentioned an entire folio page from the first printed
     Bible, the magnificent work of Gutenberg, richly adorned with
     ornamental borderings by a contemporary German illuminator. An
     entire page from the celebrated Psalter of Schæffer, in which
     the large capitals are printed in colours, in rivalry with the
     illuminators of the time. Pages from the first books printed in
     Italy, France, Spain, Flanders, and Holland, accompany the accounts
     of the introduction of the printing press to those countries; and
     several such entire pages in facsimile illustrate the description
     of the works of William Caxton, the founder of the printing press
     in England. In addition to these and many illustrations of other
     kinds, will be found a very interesting and an abundant series of
     examples from the most richly decorated of the French 'Horæ,' and
     from the profusely illustrated German books produced in the first
     half of the sixteenth century." The copies dated 1868 are somewhat
     inferior as regards the plates.

 HUMPHREYS. Master Pieces of the Early Printers & Engravers. A Series
 of Facsimiles from Rare and Curious Books remarkable for Illustrative
 Devices, Beautiful Borders, Decorative Initials, Printers Marks,
 Elaborate Title-pages, &c. By H. Noel Humphreys, ... Imp. 4to.
                                       _London: H. Sotheran & Co._ 1870.

     First issued in parts, which are preferable for the early
     impressions of the seventy curious plates. "The great beauty of
     many of the books produced by the Early Printers, both at regards
     the remarkable and various character of their Types, and the
     exquisitely designed Initials and Borderings with which their pages
     are enriched, is scarcely known and appreciated beyond the narrow
     circle of enthusiastic bibliographers who have made the first
     works that issued from the printing press a subject of special
     study; and it is to make them more widely known that the present
     work has been projected. The greater part of the examples are now
     published for the first time, and have never appeared in any other
     bibliographical work. They comprise designs by Wohlgemuth, Durer,
     Burgemair, Cranach, and others equally celebrated."

 [KENNETT (White).] Bibliothecæ Americanæ Primordia. An Attempt Towards
 laying the Foundation of an American Library, In several Books, Papers,
 and Writings, Humbly given to the Society for Propagation of the Gospel
 in Foreign Parts, For the Perpetual Use and Benefit of their Members,
 their Missionaries, Friends, Correspondents, and Others concern'd in
 the Good Design of Planting and Promoting Christianity within Her
 Majesties Colonies and Plantations in the West-Indies. By a Member
 of the said Society. 4to, pp. (2), xvi, iii, 275, (224).
                                           _London: J. Churchill._ 1713.

     There are copies on large paper. "In this short catalogue will be
     found about twenty original tracts relating to Newfoundland; above
     fifty concerning Virginia; one hundred, or more, of New England:
     and so on in proportion to the colonies."--_Preface._ "This, as
     far as it goes, is the best Catalogue of Books relating to America
     extant, the titles being copied at full length with the greatest
     exactness, together with name of the printer, and the number of
     pages in each volume. It unfortunately contains only the books
     given to the society by White Kennett, Bishop of Peterborough. It
     is rich in English tracts relating to New England."--RICH. The
     collection to which it refers has disappeared--some scattered and
     neglected remains were found a few years since among the archives
     of the Society at Lambeth.

     Although the real object of this monograph was the sale of a lot of
     books, it is none the less valuable as the only monograph of its
     kind in English.

     Best edition of this highly valuable and important work which
     is an alphabetical account of early French literature, the most
     extensive published. "Ces ouvrages sont très précieux pour
     l'histoire littéraire de la France, antérieure à la fin du seizième

     "A work which, for an age that offered small facility or
     encouragement to the prosecution of researches in the field
     of early English Literature, was one of _extraordinary_
     merit."--HALLIWELL. "Of the several early Catalogues of the English

 LE LONG (J.) Bibliotheca Sacra, post J. Le Long ct C. F. Boerneri

     Dr. Dibdin justly terms this work a "Standard authority on matters
     of Biblical Literature." There is scarcely an edition of the Bible
     extant in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, or Polyglots, but it is accurately
     described, and all textual, as well as typographical variations,
     pointed out; it is perhaps the most perfect Manual of Biblical
     Bibliography extant. The first edition was _Parisiis._ 1709. 2
     vols., 8vo.

 LE LONG. Bibliothèque Historique de la France, contenant le Catalogue
 des Ouvrages, imprimés & manuscrits, qui traitent ... de ce Royaume;

 536, 285; viii, 771.
             _Paris: De l'Imprimerie de Jean-Thomas Herissant._ 1768-78.

     This is perhaps the most laborious and most able bibliographical
     work which has ever appeared. It is scarcely possible to find a
     volume or a manuscript in any way connected with French history
     which is not fully described, and it frequently gives curious
     details respecting English historians. Brunet remarks "Cet ouvrage
     et un des travaux les plus essentiels qu'ait produit la science
     bibliographique, et il doit se trouver dans tous les Bibliothèques."

     the locked-up treasures of ancient and modern history, and to the

     "The author of this work, probably the first which contains a
     Catalogue of Books on America, afterwards took the surname of
     Pinelo. The following enlarged edition by Barcia is so clumsily
     thrown together that it is quite a relief to refer from it to this
     neat and well-arranged little manual."--RICH.

     "The most complete general Bibliography of Geographical Works,
     Travels, Missionary Reports, etc. The second volume contains the
     works relating to America, and its greatest value consists in the
     notices it gives of the Spanish manuscripts on the subjects, most
     of which are still existing in Spain."--RICH. See also Harrisse's

     This very excellent catalogue was the joint labors of Messrs.
     Upcott, Brayley, and Thompson, to whom great credit is due for the
     able manner in which they have performed so long and tedious a task.

 LOW. An Index to Current Literature; comprising a Reference to the
 Author and Subject of every Book in the English Language, and the
 Articles in Literature, Science, and Art, in several Publications.
 1859, 1860, 1861. By Sampson Low. 8vo, pp. lxxxvi, 170. _London._ 1862.

     A most valuable index to serial literature, discontinued from want
     of public appreciation and support.

 LOWNDES (W. T.) The Bibliographer's Manual of English Literature,
 containing an account of Rare, Curious, and Useful Books, published
 in or Relating to Great Britain and Ireland, from the Invention of
 Printing; with Bibliographical and Critical Notices, Collations of the
 Rarer Articles, and the Prices at which they have been sold in this
 Present Century. By William Thomas Lowndes. 4 vols., 8vo, pp. xii,
 2002.                          _London: William Pickering._ MDCCCXXXIV.

     First published as a serial; Part 1. is dated 1828. Invaluable to
     the collector or librarian. The type of this is larger than that of
     the following edition:

 LOWNDES. [Same Title.] New Edition, Revised, Corrected and Enlarged, By
 Henry G. Bohn. 6 vols., 8vo, pp. 2746. _London: Henry G. Bohn._ 1857-69.

     Issued in eleven parts, each of which contains some preliminary,
     explanatory, or exculpatory notice by Mr. Bohn. It is much to
     be regretted that the earlier part of the work does not include
     the same ratio of additions as the later, and book-collectors,
     in general, would have been pleased to pay a higher price for
     a handsomer book. Mr. Bohn's name as editor did not appear on
     the first title to Vol. 1. Power remarks "A good guide to Mr.
     Bohn's various reprints and 'Libraries,' and the appendix is a
     carefully-compiled list of the publications of the Book-printing
     Clubs, the private presses, such as Strawberry Hill, Lee Priory,
     &c., and the rare reprints of Collier, Halliwell, Maidment,
     Turnbull, and others. _The Bibliographer's Manual_ is a work which,
     for want of a better, no English book-lover can do without. The
     first edition has the advantage of Mr. Bohn's, being printed in
     more legible type." Later issues bear the name of _Bell & Daldy_ as
     publishers. In 1869, two hundred and fifty copies were printed on
     large paper, in 6 vols., cr. 8vo. The statement that one hundred
     copies were printed on large paper, which appears on that number
     of copies which were sent to America, is, to say the least, an
     abbreviation of the truth. Mr. Bohn's eleven prefatory notices,
     which to some extent explain the nature and extent of his labors,
     have been omitted in the large paper copies, both editions being
     in other respects exactly the same. There is no substitute for
     _The Bibliographer's Manual_; undertaken originally to supply an
     obvious desideratum felt by all readers and book-buyers, it forms
     at once a key to the riches of English literature for the student,
     and a guide in the formation of a library for the collector. In
     its present enlarged form it comprises notices of upwards of one
     hundred thousand distinct books published in Great Britain and
     Ireland, but it is susceptible of much improvement.

 LOWNDES. The British Librarian, or Book Collector's Guide to the
 formation of a Library, in all Branches of Literature, ... With Prices,
 Critical Notes, References, and an Index of Authors and Subjects....
 By William T. Lowndes. 8vo, 1320 columns.
                                    _London: Whittaker and Co._ 1839-42.

     Eleven parts; comprising "Religion and its History," being all
     that were published. It is a valuable Bibliography of Theological
     Literature; its completion was prevented by the death of the author.

 LOWNDES. Shakespeare and his Commentators, from Lowndes'
 Bibliographer's Manual. 8vo. Portrait.                  _London._ 1831.

     Fifty-two copies printed--not for sale. This was reproduced with
     additions as below:

 LOWNDES. A Bibliographical Account of the Works of Shakespeare,
 including every known Edition, Translation, and Commentary. By
 Henry G. Bohn. Printed off separately from his enlarged edition of
 the Bibliographer's Manual, with some Additions. Sm. 4to, pp. (4),
 2253-2368.                                              _London._ 1868.

     The additions contain lists of the early quartos in the library of

                        _New York: Printed for the Author._ M.DCCC.XLVI.

     Privately printed, and scarce. A Supplement was subsequently
     printed in the _Literary World_, of which twenty-six copies only
     were separately printed--that being the number of persons who had
     the politeness to acknowledge the gift of the "Essay."

 Ludewig. With Additions and Corrections, By Professor Wm. W. Turner.
 Edited by Nicolas Trübner. 8vo, pp. viii, (1), ix-xxiv, 258.

     With two indexes, one of authors and the other of works.

 927; (2), 799; (6), 725.            _Lisboa, Off. de Fonseca._ 1741-59.

     The extreme rarity of this great work, the highest authority upon
     Portuguese bibliography, arises from the circumstance that a large
     proportion of the first three volumes perished by fire at Lisbon in
     1755. _See_ Petzholdt, p. 381.

     No more of the translation published. For the title of the original
     _see_ Petzholdt, p. 650.

 xxii, (1), 464.                      _Privately Printed, London._ 1843.

     Very scarce; a few copies only having been printed for presents.
     The compiler was the keeper of the manuscripts and libraries of
     the Archbishop of Canterbury, and thus had unusual facilities for
     giving accurate descriptions of, and extracts from, the various
     works.

     Very scarce; most of the copies having been destroyed by fire.
     It is to be regretted that when the author undertook this work
     he had not made himself better acquainted with the duties of a
     bibliographer--to say that it is carelessly done, is but mild
     criticism. The critical notices are numerous, voluminous, and often
     unnecessary.

     translations of the titles, with critical and other notes
     concerning the books, and is a most desirable addition to a

     descriptions few and meagre. Each volume has a good, systematic,

     The value, importance, and great rarity of a complete copy of
     this work is well known. As it was twenty years in course of
     publication, very few complete sets were ever made up, but it is
     especially rare to find the two supplemental volumes. Sir M. Sykes'
     copy sold for £84.

     "It is impossible in a small space to give anything like an
     adequate idea of the vast amount of curious information which
     these volumes contain. The hundreds of literary celebrities who
     are brought forward not merely by passing anecdotes but by highly
     valuable memoirs and sketches, and the extensive bibliographical
     and literary matter which they contain, render this one of the most
     permanently interesting sets of books ever published." Vols. vii.
     and viii. are additions by the author's son, J. B. Nichols.

     No. 6,292 is the celebrated Valdarfer Boccaccio of 1471, the only
     known copy, which was purchased by the Marquis of Blandford for
     £2,260, the highest price ever paid for a single volume. Dibdin
     gives (_more suo_) a long account of the contest for this volume in
     his _Bibliographical Decameron_, III. 62-65. The Roxburghe Club was
     one of the results of this famous sale.

     To collectors of works, containing early or local proverbs, a study
     as entertaining, as useful to the etymologist, this manual will be
     found indispensable, as there are many works, particularly among
     those early printed, which contain proverbs among other matter,
     though not clearly stated in the title; it is, in fact, a very
     extensive chronological list of proverbial works, and a collection
     of proverbs in all languages. _See_ Petzholdt, p. 697.

     be found very useful in the collation of early rare editions. Vol.

     elaborate Index, not only to Books, but to articles on Art in

     This is doubtless the largest catalogue ever put forth by a
     bookseller. The bibliographical notes appended to the rare or most
     important books are distinguished by much learning and critical
     research, and are tolerably free from the trade bias which usually
     accompanies a bookseller's catalogue.

     Quérard quarreled with his publisher, and, after p. 282 of Vol.
     II. of the _Littérature française contemporaine_, the compilation
     was made by Louandre, Bourquelot, and Maury. Quérard published a
     Tome XI. of _La France littéraire_, with the title: "Les écrivains

     "This noble library, vast in its numbers, and profound in the
     learning of its contents, is a monument worthy of the memory of
     its author's name, as to biblical, theological, grammatical, and
     critical literature, in the Greek and Roman, as well as the Hebrew

     Sir Walter Scott, where he refers to, or quotes, the various books
     in the library. "The nature and extent of the collection throw
     light in a remarkable manner on the history of its founder. The
     reader has before him a faithful inventory of the materials with
     which the national poet and novelist had stored his mind before he
     began his public career, and of the zeal with which he watched the
     progress of literary enterprise down to the close of his life."

     Two hundred and fifty copies printed. The two leaves, subsequently
     printed, giving an account of the sale of the edition at auction,
     at the upset price of £9 per set, should be added, "a result," says
     Mr. Sotheby "unparalleled in the annals of literature." One of
     the most important works ever produced upon the history of early
     printing, on which it throws great additional light. It contains
     an extended examination of the various editions of the block books
     (or books printed from wooden blocks), the earliest productions
     of the art, issued in Holland, Flanders, and Germany, such as the
     Apocalypsis S. Johannis, Biblia Pauperum, Ars Moriendi, Cantica
     Canticorum, Liber Regum, Temptationes Dæmonum, Ars Memorandi,
     Endkrist, Quindecim Signa, De Generatione Christi, Miribilia Romæ,
     etc. It is not, however, confined to a history of block books, for
     it gives minute accounts, accompanied by exact facsimiles, of some
     of the most interesting and rare works printed with movable type in
     the infancy of the art, such as the Donatuses, Doctrinale, Catonis
     Disticha, Horarium, Facetiæ, Morales, Speculum Humanæ Salvationis,
     Bartolomæus van de Proprietaten der Dinghen, Exhortatio contra
     Turcos, Literæ Indulgentiarum, etc.

     the _Principia Typographica_. It contains 100 facsimile plates of
     the productions of the early printers, with the initials colored
     and illuminated in gold, in imitation of the originals, besides

     a very useful work with which to identify the books which have
     neither name of printer or place of printing.

 STEVENS. Historical Nuggets Bibliotheca Americana or a Descriptive
 Account of my Collection of Rare Books relating to America. Henry
 Stevens GMB FSA. 2 vols., fcap 8vo, pp. xii, 436; (2), 437-805.
             _London: Printed by Whittingham and Wilkins_ ... MDCCCLXII.

     "Printed in the best style of the Chiswick Press, regardless of
     time, it comprises 2934 titles given in full, with the collation
     and price of each work. It was intended as far as it went to be
     a manual for collectors of this expensive class of books. But it
     did not go very far, containing as it does, not a selection, but
     only such books as the author happened to possess at that time.
     It was intended to supply the deficiencies by additional volumes,
     but these have never appeared, and probably never will in this
     form."--_Author._ A few copies were issued in 1858 with a different
     title. _See_ Petzholdt, p. 812.

 [STEVENS.] Bibliotheca Americana. A Catalogue of Books relating to the

 pp. vi, 273.                               _London. March_, M.DCCC.LXI.

     Also on large paper, rl. 8vo. This catalogue contains 2415 lots,
     with collations, etc., and will be useful to the collector. It is,
     in fact, an abridgment of Stevens' _Historical Nuggets_, although
     the latter was not published till 1862. It is one of the most
     carefully prepared auction catalogues ever issued.

 STEVENS. Bibliotheca Historica; or, a Catalogue of ... Books and

 South America; among which is included the larger proportion of the

     Beautifully printed and profusely annotated. One of the few
     bibliographical works which combines amusement with profit and
     instruction.

     Contains the titles of the best editions of the principal standard
     authors sufficient to form a library of about 6000 volumes. The
     contents of the several volumes of the chief polygraphic works are
     given; also the dates of birth and death of most of the deceased
     authors.

     All the copies we have seen of this are marked proof, and the
     introduction is unfinished. Also on large paper, rl. 8vo.

     "The pleasure we have experienced in perusing these sheets, has
     been considerably heightened by our confidence in the accuracy of
     the contents (Major Stewart giving notes and references from the
     most authentic materials), and from the modest, unassuming manner
     in which the whole is written. The work Major Stewart proposed to
     write was one of great curiosity to all classes of readers, and a
     desideratum of real consequence to Oriental scholars."--_British
     Critic._

 STEWART (C. J.) Catalogue of the Library collected by Miss Richardson

     This catalogue, now rare, contains much more than that by
     Triphook. See _Notes and Queries_, Second Series, XII. 77. Mr.
     Stewart's catalogues of his own stock are replete with valuable
     bibliographical and critical notices. It is no exaggeration to say
     that in the departments of literature to which Mr. Stewart has
     given special attention he is the best living authority.

 THOMAS (I.) The History of Printing in America. With a Biography of

 View of the Discovery and Progress of the Art in other parts of the
 World.... By Isaiah Thomas, Printer, Worcester, Massachusetts. 2 vols.,
 8vo, pp. 487; 576.
                _Worcester: From the Press of Isaiah Thomas, Jun._ 1810.

     This valuable work, written and published in advance of the time,
     met with no favor, and was quickly forgotten. It was reprinted with
     the following title:

 THOMAS. The History of Printing in America: ... By Isaiah Thomas,
 LL.D. ... Second Edition. With the Author's Corrections and Additions,
 and a Catalogue of American Publications previous to the Revolution of
 1776.... 2 vols., 8vo, pp. lxxxvii, 423, Portrait; 666, Index, (50).
                           _Albany, N. Y.: Joel Munsell, Printer._ 1874.

     In this edition some of the matter in the first it omitted.
     The list of ante-revolutionary publications is far from being
     complete, and it is much to be regretted that many of the titles
     are not given correctly; one specimen is conspicuous: on page 405,
     article Bass, an error in the Massachusetts Catalogue is pointed
     out, but the title is turned round. There is nothing in the title
     about Benjamin Colman, and the collation is pp. (2), iii, 40;
     the printer's name is not given. Errors like these swarm in the
     list, a circumstance to be regretted, as a little additional labor
     would have made that right which is now wrong. It is the more
     inexcusable, as a reference to Sabin's _Dictionary_ would have
     furnished many titles entirely omitted or incorrectly described.

     Of this valuable catalogue very few copies were printed, all for
     presents. Archdeacon Cotton, who refers to this work in almost
     every page of his list of the various editions of the Holy
     Scriptures, says, "I have much pleasure in testifying to the great
     accuracy and minuteness of the collations and descriptions in
     this most valuable catalogue. Those of the earlier and more rare
     editions are given with a fullness and distinctness which leaves
     nothing to desire. I could not insert all those particulars into
     a slight work like the present list; but confidently refer those
     persons who desire more detailed notice of any remarkable edition
     to this curious and valuable catalogue of Mr. Wilson."

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
