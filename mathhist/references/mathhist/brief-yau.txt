This progress emerged from the previous context of attempts to solve polynomial equations, which had been a major focus of mathematicians for centuries. Prior to Gauss's proof, it was not clear whether every polynomial equation had a solution, and many mathematicians had attempted to find a general solution for all polynomial equations. Gauss's proof not only provided a solution to this problem, but also paved the way for further developments in algebraic geometry and number theory.

Building on this result, Gauss founded modern number theory and made significant contributions to the study of prime numbers. In particular, he discovered the Prime Number Theorem, which describes the distribution of prime numbers among the integers.

15

[1929] Hermann Weyl defined the concept of a manifold, which is a mathematical space that locally resembles Euclidean space, but globally may have a more complicated structure. He then used the method of projection to prove Hodge decomposition for Riemann surfaces, which states that any differential form on a Riemann surface can be decomposed into a sum of harmonic forms, exact forms, and co-exact forms. This progress emerged from the study of differential forms by Grassmann, Poincaré, Cartan, and de Rham, and provided a powerful tool for understanding the geometry and topology of curved spaces.

15

[1948] Georges de Rham proved the de Rham's theorem, which is a fundamental result in differential geometry. This theorem establishes the equivalence between the cohomology of a smooth manifold and the space of closed differential forms on that manifold. In other words, it shows that every closed differential form on a manifold can be written as the sum of an exact differential form and a harmonic differential form. This result builds on the work of Hermann Grassmann, Henri Poincaré, Élie Cartan, and Hermann Weyl, who studied differential forms and manifolds and developed the tools and concepts necessary for de Rham's theorem.

15

[1937] William Hodge generalized the theory of manifolds introduced by Hermann Weyl to higher dimensions. He also introduced the star operator, which is a linear operator that maps p-forms to (n-p)-forms on an n-dimensional manifold. This operator plays a crucial role in the Hodge decomposition theorem, which states that any differential form on a compact Riemannian manifold can be uniquely decomposed into a sum of harmonic forms, closed forms, and exact forms. Hodge's work built upon the earlier contributions of Grassmann, Poincaré, Cartan, de Rham, and Weyl, and has had far-reaching implications in geometry, topology, and mathematical physics.

[1950] William Hodge generalized the theory of Hermann Weyl to higher dimensional manifolds and introduced the star operator. He then refined the decomposition theory for differential forms on Kähler manifolds and put the topological theorems of Lefschetz into a representation on the space of Hodge forms. This progress emerged from the previous context of the study of differential forms and manifolds by Grassmann, Poincaré, Cartan, de Rham, and Weyl, as well as the proof of de Rham's theorem by de Rham himself. Hodge's contributions built upon these earlier works and extended them to higher dimensions and more complex structures.

This observation emerged from the works of Daniel Quillen and Kuo-Tsai Chen on iterated integrals. In other words, Sullivan showed that the de Rham complex can be used to study the algebraic structure of the manifold's homotopy groups. This was a significant development in algebraic topology, as it provided a new tool for studying the topology of manifolds.

Specifically, they showed that if a simply connected manifold's rational cohomology ring is not generated by one element, then it has infinitely many geometrically distinct geodesics. This result emerged from the previous context of the study of differential forms, manifolds, and their topological properties, including the Hodge decomposition and de Rham's theorem. The observation that the de Rham complex contains information about the rational homotopy of a manifold was made by Sullivan based on the works of Quillen and Chen. The refinement of the theory of manifolds by Hodge and the use of the star operator were also important contributions to this context.

Abel's work built upon the earlier work of Galois, who had developed the theory of groups to study the solvability of polynomial equations. Abel's proof showed that there is no general formula for finding the roots of a polynomial equation of degree greater than 4 using only the arithmetic operations and radicals. This result had far-reaching implications for algebra and led to the development of new branches of mathematics, such as abstract algebra and algebraic geometry.

It provides a precise criterion for determining whether a polynomial equation can be solved by radicals. This theory has deep consequences in number theory, including the proof of the impossibility of trisecting an angle and doubling the cube using only a compass and straightedge. It also led to the development of abstract algebra and the concept of a field extension.

[1843] William Hamilton introduced quaternion numbers, which extended the concept of complex numbers to four dimensions. This progress emerged from the previous context of complex numbers, which are numbers of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit, defined as the square root of -1. Hamilton realized that a similar extension could be made to three dimensions by introducing three imaginary units, i, j, and k, such that i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1. This led to the development of quaternion algebra, which has applications in physics, computer graphics, and other fields.

17

[1843] William Hamilton introduced quaternion number, which had a significant impact on mathematics and physics. One of the notable applications of quaternion was in the work of Paul Dirac, who used it in his Dirac operator. This operator is a mathematical tool that describes the behavior of particles with spin in quantum mechanics. The use of quaternion in this context emerged from its properties, which allowed for the representation of rotations in three-dimensional space. This representation was crucial in developing the Dirac operator, which has become an essential tool in modern physics.

Later, in the same year, octonions (or Cayley numbers) were independently introduced by Arthur Cayley and John T. Graves. This progress marked the emergence of a new class of numbers that extended the concept of complex numbers to higher dimensions. The study of these numbers and their properties has led to the development of new mathematical theories and applications in physics, including the work of Paul Dirac on the Dirac operator. The introduction of quaternion and octonion numbers opened up new avenues for research in algebra and geometry, and their study continues to be an active area of research today.

[1884] Hermite proved that e (the base of natural logarithm) is a transcendental number, meaning it cannot be expressed as a root of any non-zero polynomial with rational coefficients. This result led to the development of Diophantine approximation, which is concerned with approximating real numbers by rational numbers. In this subject, the goal is to find rational numbers that are as close as possible to a given real number, and the quality of the approximation is measured by the difference between the two. One important result in Diophantine approximation is the continued fraction expansion, which provides a way to represent a real number as an infinite sequence of integers. This representation can be used to find rational approximations with increasingly better accuracy.

This method emerged from the previous context of Diophantine approximation as a way to approach the problem using geometric concepts. Minkowski's method involves representing the set of solutions to a Diophantine equation as a convex region in n-dimensional space, and then using geometric properties of this region to find rational approximations to real numbers. This approach has been further developed and refined by later mathematicians, and remains an important tool in the study of Diophantine equations.

This mathematical progress emerged from the need to study spaces of functions that are complete with respect to a certain norm. Banach spaces have many important properties, such as the Hahn-Banach theorem, which allows for the extension of linear functionals, and the Banach-Steinhaus theorem, which guarantees uniform boundedness of certain families of linear operators. The concept of Banach space has had a profound impact on many areas of mathematics, including functional analysis, harmonic analysis, and partial differential equations.

[1980] Alain Connes introduced non-commutative geometry, which builds upon the operator algebra introduced by John von Neumann and the work of Tomita-Takesaki in studying quantum field theory. Non-commutative geometry is a mathematical framework that extends traditional geometry to non-commutative spaces, where the order of multiplication matters. It has applications in various fields, including physics, number theory, and computer science.

This progress emerged from the previous context of operator algebra and non-commutative geometry, which were used to study quantum field theory. The Jones polynomial is a mathematical tool that can be used to distinguish between different types of knots and links in three-dimensional space. It is a quantum invariant because it is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which allow for the existence of superpositions and entanglement. The Jones polynomial has important applications in topology, quantum computing, and statistical mechanics.

47

[1932] John von Neumann and Lev Landau introduced the concept of the density matrix in quantum mechanics. The density matrix is a mathematical tool used to describe the state of a quantum system that is not in a pure state, meaning it is not described by a single wave function. It is a matrix that contains information about the probabilities of finding the system in different states. This concept emerged from the need to describe the behavior of quantum systems that are in contact with their environment, which can cause them to lose coherence and become mixed states. The density matrix allows for a more general description of quantum systems and has become an important tool in quantum mechanics and quantum information theory.

[1932] John von Neumann extended the classical Gibbs entropy to quantum mechanics by introducing the concept of the density matrix. This mathematical progress emerged from the need to describe the behavior of quantum systems that are not in pure states, but rather in mixed states. The density matrix is a mathematical tool that allows us to describe the statistical behavior of a quantum system in a mixed state. Von Neumann's extension of the Gibbs entropy to quantum mechanics allowed for the calculation of the entropy of a mixed state, which is a measure of the degree of disorder or uncertainty in the system. This mathematical progress was a significant step in the development of quantum mechanics, as it allowed for the description of a wider range of physical phenomena, including the behavior of systems in thermal equilibrium and the measurement process in quantum mechanics.

This connection emerged from the observation that the study of algebraic curves over finite fields could shed light on the behavior of prime numbers. Weil's work on the Riemann hypothesis, which concerns the distribution of prime numbers, led him to develop a new approach to algebraic geometry that incorporated ideas from number theory. He introduced the concept of adeles, which are a way of compactifying the rational numbers, and used them to define a new cohomology theory that could be applied to algebraic varieties over any field. This theory, known as étale cohomology, has become a fundamental tool in modern algebraic geometry and has led to many important results in number theory, such as the proof of the Weil conjectures.

[1950] C. B. Morrey made a breakthrough in mathematics by solving the classical uniformization theorem with rough coefficients. This progress emerged from previous attempts to understand the geometry of surfaces and their conformal mappings. The uniformization theorem states that any simply connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to one of three standard models: the unit disk, the complex plane, or the Riemann sphere.

51

[1984] C. B. Morrey made significant contributions to the field of differential geometry by solving two important problems. Firstly, he solved the classical uniformization theorem with rough coefficients, which had been a long-standing open problem in the field. This theorem concerns the classification of simply connected Riemann surfaces, and Morrey's solution extended the existing results to surfaces with more general properties.

Secondly, Morrey solved the Plateau problem for general Riemannian manifolds, which had previously been solved only for Euclidean spaces. The Plateau problem concerns the existence of minimal surfaces spanning a given boundary curve, and Morrey's solution generalized the work of Jesse Douglas and Tibor Radó to more general settings.

This theory emerged from the study of homotopy groups of spheres and the desire to understand when two manifolds are "the same" up to a certain equivalence relation. Cobordism theory allows one to compare manifolds by considering their boundaries and the ways in which they can be smoothly connected to one another. This led to important results in algebraic topology, such as the classification of high-dimensional manifolds and the discovery of exotic spheres.

This result was a breakthrough in the theory of smooth structures for manifolds and opened up new avenues of research in topology. Milnor's proof relied on the use of cobordism theory, which had been developed by Lev Pontryagin and René Thom, and Hirzebruch's signature formula for differentiable manifolds. By combining these tools, Milnor was able to construct a manifold that was cobordant to the seven-sphere but had different Pontryagin numbers, thus proving the existence of the exotic seven-sphere.

53

[1971] Stephen Cook proposed a precise statement about the complexity of theorem proving, building on the concept of computability introduced by Alan Turing. Cook's statement, known as the "Cook-Levin theorem," proposed that the problem of determining whether a Boolean formula is satisfiable is NP-complete, meaning that it is one of the hardest problems in computer science. This result had important implications for the study of algorithms and complexity theory, and helped to establish the field of computational complexity. Leonid Levin also independently proposed this problem around the same time.

Valiant's concept of completeness provided a framework for understanding the difficulty of counting solutions to problems, which is a fundamental aspect of computational complexity theory. By showing that certain problems are complete for a class of problems called #P, Valiant provided a way to reason about the inherent difficulty of counting problems in a way that is analogous to the way that Cook's concept of NP-completeness provides a way to reason about the inherent difficulty of decision problems.
